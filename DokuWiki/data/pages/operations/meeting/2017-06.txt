====== 13 June 2017 ======

  * Speaker: Alex Bruneau
  * Title: Intelligent Availability; The evolution of High Availability
  * Contact: Myles

Alex will discuss the tenants of and concepts behind "Intelligent Availability" and how it provides "next gen" availability. The "Anvil!" platform is the first full IA platform, combining a fully redundant architecture along with the 100% open source Striker UI and ScanCore "decision engine". A live demonstration of this platform will be used to show IA in action. Various faults will be induced, showing how the Anvil! autonomously reacts to mitigate these changing risks.

Attendees will be learn how to apply these IA techniques and concepts, allowing them to make their own IT environments more resilient.

Alex Bruneau is the head of customer support at Alteeve.

Alteeve is the company of Esteemed Community Member, Madison Kelly.

I'll need about 30 minutes access before hand to setup the demo cluster.
If the room is up stairs, I'll either need an elevator or a couple
strong people to help move the box. The main chassis is ~200lbs and a
pair of 75lbs UPSes. I'll need two outlets, too. I do not need internet,
I'll set things up to run through my phone.

That'll be the box (though the UPSes will be on their own, I can't fit
both road chassis in my car. lol).
