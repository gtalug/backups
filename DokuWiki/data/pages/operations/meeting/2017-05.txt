  * Speaker: Dhaval Giani
  * Title: Lessons learnt as a maintainer
  * Contact: [[user:myles|Myles]]

I have been an upstream maintainer of libcgroup. As a maintainer, I 
have had varied experiences which have taught me important lessons. 
This talk goes over some anecdotes, and hopefully they provide some 
humour and some lessons.
