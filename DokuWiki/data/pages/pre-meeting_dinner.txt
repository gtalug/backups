====== GTALUG Pre-Meeting Dinner Options ======

======= Some Operating Principles =======

  - Needs to be open at compatible hours.  Some downtown places close too early.
  - Needs to allow a group to dribble in.  If it requires formal seating, that's likely undesirable.
  - Needs enough seating that 10 people can be readily accommodated.
  - Some restaurants (Salad King, I'm looking at you!) are so noisy that people cannot readily talk over noise.  (And then it escalates into trying to yell, and it's all downhill from there!)
