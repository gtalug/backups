====== Guide to Presenting at GTALUG ======

First please review our [[https://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/|Code of Conduct]], we want a productive happy meetings that can welcome new ideas and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests, and skills.

===== Audience =====

==== Demographic ====

  * Users, students, system admins and developers.
  * High level of knowledge (or at least interested) in computing.
  * Roughly half are in the technology industry, a quarter are studying technology in school, and the rest will be users.

=== Participation ===

  * Set the ground rules for asking questions before the meeting:
    * Can people just ask questions whenever they want? //This will be the default for you talk//
    * Do you want people to wait to ask questions until the end of your talk?

===== Internet Access =====

Don't count on having access to the Internet in the meeting space (even if you bring a mobile hotspot the reception in the room will be horrible). It's a good idea to have everything you need running on your local hard drive.

==== Tips and Tricks =====

  * If you have a Video on Youtube, Vimeo, etc. you'd like to reference, the [[http://youtube-dl.org/|youtube-dl]] or [[https://you-get.org/|you-get]] utility can be used to make a offline copy.
