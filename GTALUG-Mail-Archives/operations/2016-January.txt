Subject: [GTALUG-Ops] Advice -- Good Source In The GTA For Desktop PC
	For Debian 8?

Hi Steve,

The best place to look for Debian compatible hardware would be Debian
wiki pages on it here: <https://wiki.debian.org/Hardware>.

>From personal experience I would say most computers, older than one to
two years, would be compatible with Debian and most Linux Distros.
Linux drive support sometimes takes a about a year to get comparable
with Windows.

If you are looking to get a computer with Ubuntu (a Debian variant)
System76 <https://system76.com/> and Dell's XPS 13 Developer Edition
<http://www.dell.com/ca/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd> can be shipped to
Canada.

If you are looking for advices for computers today that would support
Linux (or generally Linux support queries) from our entire user group
you can join our discussion mailing list:
<http://gtalug.org/mailman/listinfo/talk>. There are a lot of new and
experienced Linux users their that can answer your questions.

It would be really awesome if you could come out to a meeting some
time. They happen on the second Tuesday of the month, January's
meeting is on 12th at 7:30pm at Ryerson University and you can find
more information here: <http://gtalug.org/meeting/2016-01/>.

Have an awesome day, and happy open-sourcing :-).

If you noticed today I let though a recruiters email of a job posting in
Markham to the GTALUG discussion list[1].

I did this because it passed GTALUG's un-written procedure of what to do
with job postings which are:

1) The sender is subscribed to the mailing list prior to posting the
message.
2) The job they are posting must be located in the Greater Toronto Area.
3) The skill set required must be related to Linux and/or Open Source.

Are people happy with this procedure or would you prefer absolutely no
job postings?

It seems fine to me, too.

Is there somewhere that we should note down the policy?

I do indeed like the policy declaration, of involving
1.  Sender is relevant (subscriber),
2.  Location is relevant,
3.  Skills seem relvant.

Nice combination of requirements.

No it's on a piece of paper. We only get 1 license a month and have to
give it out as a prize at the meeting so you will have to be the first
to answer the skill testing question at the meeting.

I'm good with any of the choices.

The only caution I can throw in here is that Starbucks can be a wee bit
crowded - I don't know what it's  like now, though.

Hi, I'm one of the moderators for the GTALUG Talk Discussion list and it
seems your email address <littlebear at xxw.ca> is being forwarded to your
Jira support system. This is causing our members to be spammed with
emails asking them to create an account on your system.

For the time being I am disabling your email address from receiving

<talk-owner at gtalug.org> and someone will allow you to receive email again.

Have an awesome day, and happy open-sourcing :-).

I'm scheduled to work until 8:30 monday, a situation I wasn't able to 
change.

This rules out my place for this Month.

If you don't mind sharing space with the stitching group. Hacklab is 
still good. Otherwise the Starbucks.


+0 Starbucks, but I won't be able to make it.
+1 Hacklab, and I'll be really late (I also have a sewing project).

Job Posting bring added value to our members, so yes I'm for it. The 
constraints above are very reasonable and necessary.

I have two notifications telling me it's at Hacklab, and another on my
Gmail account telling me it's at Starbucks.

Which one?  I'm good with either.

Here's the OpenWRT page on the device I was showing off.  So apparently
it'll run OpenWRT...

Interesting … wonder if the battery backup has any kind of failover? If
so, here's my Underpants Gnomes-style plan of action:

0. Dig out one of the many Raspberry Pis littering the house
1. Install OpenWRT on an MLWG2
2. ?
3. End up with a wifi-enabled, UPS-protected Raspberry Pi with its own
   mini-NAS.

cheers,
 Stewart
