Sorry I meant to send this to the ops list and not the general one.

It looks like a useable application.

Hey guys,

I'm going over backup scripts trying to replicate it on my machine as
well as writing restore scripts. I have a question about
archive-subscribers.sh.

First of all I don't have gpg key so the backup command fails whenever I
try to run it, and most importantly, I looks like the script doesn't
copy from or run anything on penguin. Where does the data come from?

Alex.

As Myles mentioned, the tool is mailman-subscribers.py

That is regrettably underdocumented; I have added a link to the tool.

As for the GPG keys, you should be able to pull the two keys that are
listed from any public key server.

I wouldn't object at all to adding your key to the list, too.

Thanks Myles, Chris, that makes sense; I got this part working.

I have another question, there's bunch of directories in ${HOME} like

GTALUG/backups
GitStuff/
GitConfig

Do you mind if I put everything in the same place?

I'm not an expert in bash, what does this mean, is that some kind of
substitution?

MAILMANSUBTOOL=${MAILMANSUBTOOL:-"${HOME}/GitStuff/mailman-subscribers/mailman-subscribers.py"}

I'm thinking of downloading all tools & ini files in a single directory
so I can get everything to work once I pull the repo.

Those are all references to places where I put things on my systems,
artifacts of my personal naming conventions.

You can feel free to assign MAILMANSUBTOOL something else to shift it
somewhere else.

I suggest doing so in your environment, so that the code in the script
remains unchanged.  The point of having the default set was so we
wouldn't be fighting over that line of code.  Do your own thing
beforehand, so we can leave the line of code defining MAILMANSUBTOOL
alone.

That sounds pretty apropos.

I'm trying to get the keys with the following command --

|gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x6AA6A713
gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 0x5A2FE7BF

But it fails with 
|

gpg: requesting key 6AA6A713 from hkp server keys.gnupg.net
gpgkeys: key 6AA6A713 can't be retrieved
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
gpg: Total number processed: 0

I tried the same command without specifying keyserver name, but got the
same result. Is there something wrong with my system gpg config?

I forked the repository and working on backup instructions here --
https://github.com/avolkov/backups

Alex.

This webinar describes the proposal.   

And I do admit, the timing is not that good, but there it is.

I'm still trying to get backups running.

Mysteriously, I was able to pull pgp keys on my other computer. But I
still can't pull them on the main one.

Anyway, I have another question about archive-subscribers.sh

There's this line that points to the configuration file, but is not
referenced anywhere else --

MAILMANPASSDIR=${MAILMANPASSFILE:-"${HOME}/GitConfig/InitFiles/GTALUG/"}

 I looked on penguin but didn't see files name like that, I'm assuming
it's something like --

ssh penguin.gtalug.org "/usr/lib/mailman/bin/list_members operations" >
operations

Is this correct? Is there anything else in
"${HOME}/GitConfig/InitFiles/GTALUG/"?

Thanks.

 Alex

Curious.  Sounds like a resolution problem, that DNS is somehow not
resolving the default keyserver(s).

The 3 obvious files contain passwords for 3 mailing lists.

That config is living, for me, in a directory inside my own git repo.
I suppose it warrants adding a wee bit more documentation on that;
have done so.
