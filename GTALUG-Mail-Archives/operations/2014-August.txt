Everything is working.

Do we have a set of instructions like those at gtalug.org/mailing-list ?

those should be updated before the announcement, along with links to new and old archives.

I've been too busy to test.. i hope to check out stuff like the sig and to see that we've got some kind of captcha in place for subscribing.  It would profoundly suck if the spammers found us after everyone moved.

I'm trapped at an IE 8 locked down desktop at the office right now... typing on my phone.

I feel like I'm camping.

I suggest Sunday. This gives us two day to announce to the list it is
happening, listen to the gripes and decided if their warranted before we do
the switch over.

Right now you can subscribe to the mailing list but first have to get
approved to send email. Also I just setup SpamAssassin.

If anyone's got time, this is what I would like to look at, but might not have time to.  Most of it is to ensure behaviour consistent with the old list.

Spamassassin makes me a little nervous, but we're all technical and know its limits.  

Things to test:
 
Subscribe/unsubscribe.
Is there a CAPTCHA so the spammers don?t spam?
Is the CAPTCHA original enough to not get clobbered in automation
Can we go ?approve requests? mode for subscription requests i we need to?
Is there a working email address for help?
 
Reply to? does it contain the list? (i.e, test munging behavior)
Do posts contain the signature?
Does threading work
Reply-all?
Reply to list?
Attachments ? send a big one
Attachments ? send a little one
Nonsubscriber posting
 
Ban somebody
 
Is there an archive?
 
PGP mail
HTML mail
 
Do you receive your own posts?
Do you receive replies you?re cc?d on?  (twice?)

 Delivery to a non-MX domain (A-record only)
SPF, is it sender ok?
SPF good/neutral/bad sender sending to list
 
IPV6?

list is miniscule
  - Invitation only list for active board members

- TODO Scott :: Check it into the Board Git site in YAML file, please
provide (here!) the URL where we can access it.
- TODO Chris :: Cheque for Myles at next meeting
- Myles :: Set up email addresses
  - Scott wants one - scott at gtalug.org
  - Chris :: already there as chris at gtalug.org
  - Should we install IMAPD?
  - Set up shell account for Scott
- Any? :: Should someone be monitoring root email
- TODO Mike :: Ping DCB about whazzup for CAG/ICANN
- TODO Gord :: Ping Evan to talk at AGM about ICANN
- TODO Mike :: Talk on Code of Conduct for AGM
- TODO Chris :: Ask Bill if he's interested in being returning officer
- TODO Myles :: Announce election
  - 3 positions, 1 that's just 1 year
- TODO Mike :: Make a wee map of the floor plan
- TODO Chris :: Backup the mailman templates
- TODO Bill :: Pester Drew on SystemD, we'll start looking for alternative
for this next month
- TODO Mike :: GPG key
- TODO Scott :: Mail series for sunsetting TLUG list
  - One message indicating the plan
  - A weekly message until Sept 30 indicating "7 less days"
  - A final message entitled "GTALUG Mailing List Has Moved"
- TODO Scott :: Subscribe GMANE to new list
- TODO Alex :: Set up Mailman archive of the old list
  - Need mailing list (Myles)
  - May need Alex to help get more data

There are a few items where I'll be pestering a few of you more
specifically.

These are the items which came up.  They're in a branch of the code.

https://github.com/gtalug/code-of-conduct/tree/review-2014/Code-of-Conduct

I don't think it's anything controversial.  Mostly an FYI for those
who are interested.
