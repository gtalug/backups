When should we do the switch over?

Everything is working.

Do we have a set of instructions like those at gtalug.org/mailing-list ?

those should be updated before the announcement, along with links to new and old archives.

I've been too busy to test.. i hope to check out stuff like the sig and to see that we've got some kind of captcha in place for subscribing.  It would profoundly suck if the spammers found us after everyone moved.

I'm trapped at an IE 8 locked down desktop at the office right now... typing on my phone.

I feel like I'm camping.

I suggest Sunday. This gives us two day to announce to the list it is
happening, listen to the gripes and decided if their warranted before we do
the switch over.

Right now you can subscribe to the mailing list but first have to get
approved to send email. Also I just setup SpamAssassin.

If anyone's got time, this is what I would like to look at, but might not have time to.  Most of it is to ensure behaviour consistent with the old list.

Spamassassin makes me a little nervous, but we're all technical and know its limits.  

Things to test:
 
Subscribe/unsubscribe.
Is there a CAPTCHA so the spammers don?t spam?
Is the CAPTCHA original enough to not get clobbered in automation
Can we go ?approve requests? mode for subscription requests i we need to?
Is there a working email address for help?
 
Reply to? does it contain the list? (i.e, test munging behavior)
Do posts contain the signature?
Does threading work
Reply-all?
Reply to list?
Attachments ? send a big one
Attachments ? send a little one
Nonsubscriber posting
 
Ban somebody
 
Is there an archive?
 
PGP mail
HTML mail
 
Do you receive your own posts?
Do you receive replies you?re cc?d on?  (twice?)

 Delivery to a non-MX domain (A-record only)
SPF, is it sender ok?
SPF good/neutral/bad sender sending to list
 
IPV6?
