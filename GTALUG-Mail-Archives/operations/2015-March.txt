If anyone has some free time the following should get tackled soonish:

1) We need to put something on the website saying that your first message will be put in a moderation queue before you are allowed to post to the list, this is to prevent spammers. If someone could draft this up it would be really helpful. The page's source is located here: <https://github.com/gtalug/website/blob/master/pages/mailing-list.markdown>.

2) A couple of people have complained about the lack of a SSL certificate on the GTALUG.org web site (we do ask for a password with mailman sign ups). Could someone research how we could do this for free. Will this need to be renewed annually? Can a self-signed cert be okay? etc.

Cloudflare has a free https option that I believe would support our needs.
It depends on SNI, but that's supported by all modern browsers / tools.
Plus on top of that, you get a free CDN and SPDY (a/k/a HTTP/2's
predecessor) support.

Hi Myles - happy to give the OSM talk in May, then. I've presented
before, but back in the UofT days.

Any particular aspect of OpenStreetMap you'd want me to talk about?

cheers,
 Stewart

I think the last meeting was about five years ago, so we definitely need
a refresher about what issues OSM is trying to solve. Also the issues
with moving to a different open license would be interesting. We are
more interested in the philosophical than the technical.

I'm anticipating not bringing a laptop; should I be able to readily
toss my talk onto a USB stick or such and play on someone's laptop?

I imagine it would be desirable for just one person to plug in lappy
and fight through connecting to the projector; I could certainly send
copies of my talk to that person to make things as handy as
possible...

I prepped it using the Google Docs app; can export as PDF, PowerPoint, and
it's easy enough to get it into LibreOffice and into ODP form.  Any
preference???

I am pretty sure I need to be careful about font choices, as "Consolas" (on
Google Docs) isn't available widely elsewhere.

I got PowerPoint (but I'm not sure if it will work without an Internet 
connection) and a PDF viewer.

I have the font Consolas on my laptop (funny enough it's designed by 
Microsoft)

Attached is my talk in both PDF and PowerPoint formats

Take a look at how PowerPoint renders pages 2, 7, and 9.  That should
tell if it's workable; those pages did odd things when I switched
software due to disagreements on handling of fonts and image
transparency.

Hi there,

I am currently doing internship at the Free Software Foundation Europe
(FSFE), a non-profit organization that advocates the use of Free
Software and that works towards building freedom in the digital society.

On the 25th of March the FSFE will launch Document Freedom Day (DFD)
whose aim is to raise awareness about Open Standards [1]. Before the
launch of the DFD, groups from different countries have the
opportunity to register their DFD event and provide a brief
description about what people will be doing in the DFD event [2].

So far no group from Canada has registered DFD event. Therefore it
would be nice if you would decide to run DFD event and there would be
at least one group from Canada raising awareness about Open Standards.

You can order printed promotional material for free which you can use
to give out to people [3]. If you want you can also order other
available promotional materials including various posters, leaflets,
flyer's and stickers [4].

Till the 11th of March it is possible to claim funding for running of
the DFD event [5].

If you have any questions or comments please get in touch. You can
also write to: contact at documentfreedom.org

Best regards,

Miks

Myles, I sent you under separate cover a quick set of slides describing this.

Seems like a good idea to do a 2 minute run-thru of this.
