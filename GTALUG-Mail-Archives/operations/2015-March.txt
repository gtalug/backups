If anyone has some free time the following should get tackled soonish:

1) We need to put something on the website saying that your first message will be put in a moderation queue before you are allowed to post to the list, this is to prevent spammers. If someone could draft this up it would be really helpful. The page's source is located here: <https://github.com/gtalug/website/blob/master/pages/mailing-list.markdown>.

2) A couple of people have complained about the lack of a SSL certificate on the GTALUG.org web site (we do ask for a password with mailman sign ups). Could someone research how we could do this for free. Will this need to be renewed annually? Can a self-signed cert be okay? etc.

Cloudflare has a free https option that I believe would support our needs.
It depends on SNI, but that's supported by all modern browsers / tools.
Plus on top of that, you get a free CDN and SPDY (a/k/a HTTP/2's
predecessor) support.

Hi Myles - happy to give the OSM talk in May, then. I've presented
before, but back in the UofT days.

Any particular aspect of OpenStreetMap you'd want me to talk about?

cheers,
 Stewart

I think the last meeting was about five years ago, so we definitely need
a refresher about what issues OSM is trying to solve. Also the issues
with moving to a different open license would be interesting. We are
more interested in the philosophical than the technical.

I'm anticipating not bringing a laptop; should I be able to readily
toss my talk onto a USB stick or such and play on someone's laptop?

I imagine it would be desirable for just one person to plug in lappy
and fight through connecting to the projector; I could certainly send
copies of my talk to that person to make things as handy as
possible...

I prepped it using the Google Docs app; can export as PDF, PowerPoint, and
it's easy enough to get it into LibreOffice and into ODP form.  Any
preference???

I am pretty sure I need to be careful about font choices, as "Consolas" (on
Google Docs) isn't available widely elsewhere.

I got PowerPoint (but I'm not sure if it will work without an Internet 
connection) and a PDF viewer.

I have the font Consolas on my laptop (funny enough it's designed by 
Microsoft)

Attached is my talk in both PDF and PowerPoint formats

Take a look at how PowerPoint renders pages 2, 7, and 9.  That should
tell if it's workable; those pages did odd things when I switched
software due to disagreements on handling of fonts and image
transparency.

Hi there,

I am currently doing internship at the Free Software Foundation Europe
(FSFE), a non-profit organization that advocates the use of Free
Software and that works towards building freedom in the digital society.

On the 25th of March the FSFE will launch Document Freedom Day (DFD)
whose aim is to raise awareness about Open Standards [1]. Before the
launch of the DFD, groups from different countries have the
opportunity to register their DFD event and provide a brief
description about what people will be doing in the DFD event [2].

So far no group from Canada has registered DFD event. Therefore it
would be nice if you would decide to run DFD event and there would be
at least one group from Canada raising awareness about Open Standards.

You can order printed promotional material for free which you can use
to give out to people [3]. If you want you can also order other
available promotional materials including various posters, leaflets,
flyer's and stickers [4].

Till the 11th of March it is possible to claim funding for running of
the DFD event [5].

If you have any questions or comments please get in touch. You can
also write to: contact at documentfreedom.org

Best regards,

Miks

Myles, I sent you under separate cover a quick set of slides describing this.

Seems like a good idea to do a 2 minute run-thru of this.

As an aside, I would love to see a presentation on keeping time in
sync on Linuxen, with a deep dive into the innards of NTP.  Sounds
like GTALUG has the talent pool for such a presentation...

I just realized it's the forth Monday. Haven't yet seen an agenda, but I've also got a scheduling conflict. Work has put me on the late shift so I won't leave the office until 8pm. His is a problem since I have open the door for us to meet at Hacklab.

I'll see if I can get a co-worker to cover.

I'll post when I know more.

The agenda is here...
   https://github.com/gtalug/board-meetings/blob/master/_posts/2015-03-23-agenda.org

I don't think it presents *huge* problems for Scott to be
not-so-early, as long as
folk there know who to let in.  (I'll bet there's enough overlap of
people knowing
people, with the common "small world syndrome" that it won't be too much of
a problem)

The notably urgent thing we're short on at this point is a speaker for April.
We have a fair number of ideas incubating, just none maturing then.

I'm going to throw another wrench. I won't be able to make it.

Sorry.

Not to be outdone, I won't, either.

Also, I'm going to hold off my monthly ICANN report, this time, to the
31st - the NTIA Stewardship gang is meeting in Istanbul right now, so I
want to be able to include anything useful that might turn up.

It seems that everyone has issues with today.

I'm afraid that I won't be able to make it due to a mobility issue.

I *could* make it, but I might be the only one.   I'll assume no meeting in person unless I hear otherwise.

Anyone want to try the phone bridge?

I have my personal bridge line.  It's still active.  I can distribute if we go that route.

I've checked and Fellow member Alex will be around to accept people into the lab.

Buzz unit 6 when you get there.

I'll be over shortly after 8pm.

Subject: [GTALUG-Ops] GTALUG Operations @ HackLab.TO
Message-ID: <55117886.4010305@mylesbraithwaite.com>

We had a noticeably smaller group of people at last nights GTALUG 
Operations meeting at HackLab.TO.

Was this because of the location? Or was it just random?

IMHO: HackLab.TO is a great spot to do this meeting in the future as it's:

- large enough to have more than 15 people,
- it's usually quite on a Monday night (according to Scott),
- they allow food and drink (as long as you clean up after yourself),
- they have actual comfortable chairs to seat in,
- WiFi access,
- and is a staple of the Toronto Tech scene.

The only issue I have is if I was to coming early I maybe wouldn't be 
allowed in if there wasn't a member already there. But I could probably 
find a coffeeshop to sit in for 45mins so this is a minor issue.

In my case, I had a number of issues come up, rather suddenly.

As to the location, it is a bit far for me, but that isn't a
show-stopper, most of the time - usually I can find some way to schedule
around it.

I noticed your reference to a coffee shop.   I'm wondering if we
shouldn't find one to "adopt" just for that purpose.
