Subject: [GTALUG-Ops] DokuWiki Installed on Penguin
Message-ID: <55BE3640.3080601@mylesbraithwaite.com>

I installed DokuWiki on Penguin @ <http://wiki.gtalug.org/> (wait of DNS
to propagate) and setup the backup.

Can someone review the backup scrips to make sure everything will be
working okay:
<https://github.com/gtalug/backups/blob/master/scripts/backup-dokuwiki-conf.sh>
and
<https://github.com/gtalug/backups/blob/master/scripts/backup-dokuwiki-data.sh>.

 CCWG-Accountability Webinars]
Message-ID: <1438614274.25963.1.camel@larva.gordhome.local>

The attached e-mail announces the publication of the proposals for the
"IANA Stewardship Transition" that we've been working on for so long.

A bit of explaining:

The ICG proposal is a merge of the proposals from ICANN, IETF and the
Number Registries (like ARIN).  The proposal describes what happens to
ICANN (in particular) when NTIA disengages itself.

The CCWG Accountability is an ICANN working group that was intended to
deal with the fact that ICANN was accountable to NTIA for the way it
runs IANA.   Now that backstop is not there, so now what?

The Accountability proposal/report/document/whatever is intended to deal
with that through a number of changes to the way ICANN organizes itself.
A major concern here (as a preview) is what happens when the ICANN
community and the ICANN Board fundamentally disagree.

As part of all this, this particular document lays out the new bylaws
that will be required.

There are a couple of upcoming webinars that will attempt to explain
these two documents - the schedules for those are in the attached
e-mail.

So here they are, duly submitted to my ALS.

Gordon
