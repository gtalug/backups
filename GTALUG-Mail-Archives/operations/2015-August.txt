I installed DokuWiki on Penguin @ <http://wiki.gtalug.org/> (wait of DNS
to propagate) and setup the backup.

Can someone review the backup scrips to make sure everything will be
working okay:
<https://github.com/gtalug/backups/blob/master/scripts/backup-dokuwiki-conf.sh>
and

Message-ID: <1438614274.25963.1.camel@larva.gordhome.local>

The attached e-mail announces the publication of the proposals for the
"IANA Stewardship Transition" that we've been working on for so long.

A bit of explaining:

The ICG proposal is a merge of the proposals from ICANN, IETF and the
Number Registries (like ARIN).  The proposal describes what happens to
ICANN (in particular) when NTIA disengages itself.

The CCWG Accountability is an ICANN working group that was intended to
deal with the fact that ICANN was accountable to NTIA for the way it
runs IANA.   Now that backstop is not there, so now what?

The Accountability proposal/report/document/whatever is intended to deal
with that through a number of changes to the way ICANN organizes itself.
A major concern here (as a preview) is what happens when the ICANN
community and the ICANN Board fundamentally disagree.

As part of all this, this particular document lays out the new bylaws
that will be required.

There are a couple of upcoming webinars that will attempt to explain
these two documents - the schedules for those are in the attached
e-mail.

So here they are, duly submitted to my ALS.

Gordon

Dear GTALUG:

As a past sponsor of the Free Software and Open Source Symposium, we'd
like to invite you to sponsor the 14th Annual FSOSS to be held at Seneca
College, York University Campus in October 2015.  This year's conference
celebrates 30 years of the free software movement.

Sponsorship prospectus details are attached.

Please don't hesitate to contact me for more details or information.

Sincerely,

Mekki

The "base level" of sponsorship seems well outside what we'd be able to
afford.  Having a table is priced at $1000, and invited seats at the dinner
are @$250.

I suggest we encourage people to consider attending, but I'd not recommend
sponsorship being worth engaging...

August 31st is going to be in the middle of labour day weekend. I'm not
entirely sure if I can attend -- I might go camping.

Cloud at cost has 50% off sale today.

I'm looking at equivalent of what we have on linode --

*​Developer 2 Package*
2 vCPU
1GBECC RAM
20GB SSD Storage
100mbit Network
1 Static IPv4
Remote KVM/reboot
Reverse DNS (Self Serve)
Server Rebuilds (Self Serve)


Their regular price (lifetime or until company goes out of business) is
$70, today it's $35.


I don't think the board made the decision, and I think Myles experiences
some problems with it, but here it is.

I have two VPS currently running with them the Dev 1 and 2.

After having a VPS up for three days the VPS had a corrupt hard drive.
Apparently it was a bug in the *beta* version of Xen they were using
(they were using a BETA VERSION OF XEN ON A PRODUCTION SYSTEM).

They told me with one days notice that they will be moving all my VPS to
new servers but wont be taking the images with them so I will have to
set them all up again.

They randomly shutdown servers without notice.

Do a Google search and you will find basically everyone saying you get
what you paid for.

It's great if you need a backup MX or XMPP server and have it puppetised
(which is all I am currently doing with it) but if you care about uptime
on a production system it really a bad idea.

If it's the board decision about moving to Cloud at Cost I will have to
remove myself from doing any of the work on the infrastructure group as
I don't have the time to manage a server that is constantly going down
and has to be recreated all most every month.

Hey Myles,

Ok got it, it's not worth it.

I thought they were running things on VmWare. Anyway it's a moot point.

Cheap is always interesting, and if we had a configuration *so* automated
that the server would automagically get restarted, that would be one
thing.  (And I imagine a high level of "magic" in that!!!)

But if reliability is dodgy, and Myles opposes it, and seeing as we just
already paid (!) for another year of Linode, it all seems like a
non-starter to do so.
