Evan sent this to the Board list.

I think it would be awesome if he could present what he did in Geneva
for the last two years.

His presentation is only nine slides so it should be around 30 to 45 minutes.

What do you think?

I would like to see this talk, but I don't think one days notice is 
reasonable to our audience or fair marketing for the speaker.

We have lightning talks scheduled for Feburary. If Evan's talk is as 
short as you suspect Myles, then we can do a half and half on February. 
If the talk is longer, we can move the lightning talks.

This gives us time to contact and make arrangments with Evan, and have 
board meeting to sync on the decisions.

Afternoon Evan,

It's good to hear from you!

In consultation with my colleagues, we feel a topic like this deserves a 
proper spot on the roster, with ample lead time for announcing and 
promoting it.

Currently, we have Lightning talks scheduled in February, with a clear 
opening in March. If your presentation is an hour, we can move the 
lighting talks to march. If it's shorter, say a half hour, we could have 
you headline February, with lightning talks to follow.

As we've not officially announced February, we have flexibility in this.

I also suspect your offer also stems from a few years ago, when you were 
familiar with Q&As being a last ditch 'we have no topic' solution. To 
contrast, the current Round Table Q&A evolved from that as a planned 
regular part of our roster. It's proven to add value to the community by 
having these clear semi-regular cross-pollination meetings.

Please let me know your thoughts, and at the very least, I look forward 
to seeing you Tomorrow evening.

while at tomorrow at the meeting.

We might want to offer help, if anyone has skills and experience that 
would help.   Perhaps reach out to Richard and offer to let him send an 
email to "announce", to ask the community for help.

Hi Charles,

You might also contact KWLUG, as they are in your geographical region
of interest. Also, some members of KWLUG have experience organizing
large F/LOSS conferences.
