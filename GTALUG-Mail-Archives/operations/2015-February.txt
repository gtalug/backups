I have two theories, either the Sweed's snuck it through weeds of AC
power after the poem of Copenhagen or the DTMF phreakers did it by a
thorny crafty RANDom preload. You'd have to check one of the pat nt
zero con scripts handlers to find that one out. If you can't trust
your compiler, what can you trust? I'm no luddite but I know full well
why he did it.

Trade or Craft, weaving is a skill that we all need the work of the
Weavers, if we want to mend old things as well as build new ones.

So when someone comes into my neighbour hood drop in and tells me I've
had a woodpecker in my head since 1976, I look at them with a straight
face and say Soviet? or American? i mean what else can you say to
that?

Message-ID: <CAFNqd5Xb8nmdOWKNd588xJrfsUkY_HpsVRVqB6kgvSXmahrs2w@mail.gmail.com>

For those unaware, Russell Reiter has been generating crazy-seeming
ramblings on the talk list.  There are moments and parts that seem
sensible enough, but then it heads crazy.

I don't mind the occasional rant, as long as it doesn't head to being
seriously offensive, but Russell has said SOME mean-ish things, and
the rambling has been getting rather distracting.

I got the impression that DCB might have deactivated Russell's
subscription, but it seems not.

I'll suggest the possibility here that it might be necessary to knock
him off list.  I'm sad if it's necessary; he seems mostly harmless,
it's "just" a distraction.  Or perhaps a moderator (we don't formally
have one; have talked about the idea a bit) should have a side chat
with him, and come to a conclusion on what to do next.

I set his moderation flag to on until we decide what to do.

Sounds good to me

I haven't followed, the only concerning stuff I saw was:

- way off topic
- s and f bombs, but not directed at anyone

do we have an example of the inflammatory email?

IMHO, We should keep him on moderate and send him a private email.

Agreed. Can we move this conversation over to the <board at gtalug.org>
list. I would prefer this discussion not be publicly readable.

Nope, I kill-filed him (;-))

I might chose to talk to him as a private person. Does that sound like 
something that might help?

I kinda guessed that; that is what you described.

If anything is to help, I'd think that to be about the best option.

If it helps, great, if not, well, maybe he gets more forcibly
plonked, and we live with that.  It's preferable for gentle words
to resolve the matter.

I think so.  We should also leave him in moderation-land rather than
kill-file.  Anything like what he's been posting should be dropped.

The posts make me think that something is *wrong*.  Better to give him
a chance to come back later when he's feeling better.

No idea what to say though, so it's your call. :-(

Has he shown up at meetings?  Have we met him?

It seems off topic (though not offensive), so I agree that
it would be apropos not to approve it.

In case Russell is suffering from something unfortunate
(I speculate some variation of mental illness, something
with some flavour of paranoia involved, albeit without the
expertise to properly diagnose), it would be unkind
to refuse it in any cruel fashion.  And a silent silencing
is a bit cruel.

Probably worth having chat further on this tonight.  The
sorts of things worth putting into a "Sorry, we had to
bounce your message" message could include:

1.  Sorry, we felt we had to bounce your message.
2.  It seemed rather off topic.  We often allow
    a fair bit of latitude, but this was a bit too far.
3.  It seemed likely to distract discussion, and we
     thought that might not be ideal to your
     reputation.

If someone has something better than #3, that
would be super.

Maybe him an out, bounce it with a message like this in the morning.

Nope, I'm a humble poet. However in all the humility I can muster at
this point in time, I can truthfully say, I'm one of a kind.

I have updated the notes a bit further; sorry to have been silent
(e.g. - I didn't provide Myles with any Todo.sh material); I was
indeed "turning green", and wound up out of commission the next two
days with what I think was food poisoning.

https://github.com/gtalug/board-meetings/blob/master/_posts/2015-02-23-notes.org

I'm a bit surprised I got home before things got icky!

At any rate, here's the action list from this meeting:

  - Next Meeting - March 24th 7:30pm, Hacklab
  - TODO Myles :: Publish floor plan image somewhere
    - Need to design it still
    - Engage with Ryerson
  - TODO Bill :: Bring laptop bag, see if it is suitable
  - TODO Myles :: Bring VGA adaptor, see if it should go in the gear bag
  - TODO Scott :: Scott needs to get drive to Bill with Mediawiki data
  - TODO Chris :: Set up backup of the archive list
  - TODO Bill :: Ask Drew for ancient messages, not urgent at all
  - TODO Myles :: Ask if anyone has thoughts on SystemD
    - Aim at panel for April
  - TODO Chris :: Solicit Dave Tilbrook
    - Not possible 'til January
    - Eek, didn't.
    - Extra idea: Check to see if Sacha Chua would be interested in
presenting on, well, anything.
      - She has been doing some Google Hangouts-based meetups on
customizing Emacs
      - More on Org Mode?
      - Emacs Lisp?
      - Note that she's on the committee for
[[http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/content-gabriel-full.html][European
Lisp Symposium 2015]]
  - TODO Scott :: Digitize all of the GTALUG legal documents
  - TODO Alex & Amos :: Test backups.
  - TODO Scott :: Contact Sergio (GDB/LibrePlanet Ontario) for ??? meeting
  - TODO Myles :: Contact Adib, suggesting Openstack/Docker for later
  - TODO DCB and/or Gord :: Engaging with Ryerson
  - TODO All :: Figure an idea as to increasing attendance
