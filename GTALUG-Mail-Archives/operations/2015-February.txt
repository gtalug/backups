I have two theories, either the Sweed's snuck it through weeds of AC
power after the poem of Copenhagen or the DTMF phreakers did it by a
thorny crafty RANDom preload. You'd have to check one of the pat nt
zero con scripts handlers to find that one out. If you can't trust
your compiler, what can you trust? I'm no luddite but I know full well
why he did it.

Trade or Craft, weaving is a skill that we all need the work of the
Weavers, if we want to mend old things as well as build new ones.

So when someone comes into my neighbour hood drop in and tells me I've
had a woodpecker in my head since 1976, I look at them with a straight
face and say Soviet? or American? i mean what else can you say to
that?

Message-ID: <CAFNqd5Xb8nmdOWKNd588xJrfsUkY_HpsVRVqB6kgvSXmahrs2w@mail.gmail.com>

For those unaware, Russell Reiter has been generating crazy-seeming
ramblings on the talk list.  There are moments and parts that seem
sensible enough, but then it heads crazy.

I don't mind the occasional rant, as long as it doesn't head to being
seriously offensive, but Russell has said SOME mean-ish things, and
the rambling has been getting rather distracting.

I got the impression that DCB might have deactivated Russell's
subscription, but it seems not.

I'll suggest the possibility here that it might be necessary to knock
him off list.  I'm sad if it's necessary; he seems mostly harmless,
it's "just" a distraction.  Or perhaps a moderator (we don't formally
have one; have talked about the idea a bit) should have a side chat
with him, and come to a conclusion on what to do next.

I set his moderation flag to on until we decide what to do.

Sounds good to me

I haven't followed, the only concerning stuff I saw was:

- way off topic
- s and f bombs, but not directed at anyone

do we have an example of the inflammatory email?

IMHO, We should keep him on moderate and send him a private email.

Mike

Agreed. Can we move this conversation over to the <board at gtalug.org>
list. I would prefer this discussion not be publicly readable.

Nope, I kill-filed him (;-))

I might chose to talk to him as a private person. Does that sound like 
something that might help?

I kinda guessed that; that is what you described.

If anything is to help, I'd think that to be about the best option.

If it helps, great, if not, well, maybe he gets more forcibly
plonked, and we live with that.  It's preferable for gentle words
to resolve the matter.

I think so.  We should also leave him in moderation-land rather than
kill-file.  Anything like what he's been posting should be dropped.

The posts make me think that something is *wrong*.  Better to give him
a chance to come back later when he's feeling better.

No idea what to say though, so it's your call. :-(

Has he shown up at meetings?  Have we met him?
