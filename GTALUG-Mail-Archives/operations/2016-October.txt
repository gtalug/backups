About 1/3 done, it's about learning a new language by using col stuff in 
the process of rewriting a program I've done several times before. When 
I have a complete draft I'll pass it on.

Message-ID: <580D5F8A.40606@gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

It looks like my server started bouncing gtalug emails based on one of
the blocklists.

My email server config uses a couple of blocklist to filter out spam and
it looks like gtalug got reported to one of them.
Also it's kind of weird that IPv6 address is mentioned but not IPv4,
there might be an issue with IPv6 configuration for the server.

I tried delisting address/host, on spamhaus address, but it wasn't found
there. Have someone delisted the host already, or was this a transient
issue?

Alex.

Here's the message I got.
