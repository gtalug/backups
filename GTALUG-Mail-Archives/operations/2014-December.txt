Hey Everyone,

FYI, the first kick at it.

https://github.com/gtalug/website/blob/master/pages/speaking.markdown

Bad change management on my part, does the site automatically publish
the documents using the title?  The intent is to just put the thing up
for comment in a quasi-public way.

Mike

We're going to fall back to our "Round Table Q & A".

Use this description:

A Round Table Q & A is where we take questions from the audience, and 
the audience discusses and attempts to answer those questions from their 
own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow members of our community 
and discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.

My bad, I saw Myles pull out, but forgot about your part.

Can you please post your description here, and whom ever updates the 
site will include both.

I'd like to have an announce push out before the end of the day.

Can you give me a small, 2-3 sentence description of the talk. Think 
something you'd find in a Convention program listing. That will go on 
the website and email.

Make was written to avoid the problem of recompiling files that hadn't 
changed. It of course introduced a new set of problems , such as 
verbosity, and the solutions for them.  Those solutions in turn 
introduced another set of problems such as redundancy, and so on. Maven 
is one of the moderately successful attempts to solve most of them.

Ok, talk attached in pdf, which the old web site liked.

The title is "Maven, or Make for Non-Cooks", and is a brief look at the 
problems of Make, and what successor build systems did to address them.

Is this right: "Mike Hoy - Mozilla community manager, on FSOSS material on
social engineering, building community on purpose, bugzilla, getting
contributors".

Also is there a simpler title?
