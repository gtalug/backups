Hey Everyone,

FYI, the first kick at it.

https://github.com/gtalug/website/blob/master/pages/speaking.markdown

Bad change management on my part, does the site automatically publish
the documents using the title?  The intent is to just put the thing up
for comment in a quasi-public way.

We're going to fall back to our "Round Table Q & A".

Use this description:

A Round Table Q & A is where we take questions from the audience, and 
the audience discusses and attempts to answer those questions from their 
own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow members of our community 
and discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.

My bad, I saw Myles pull out, but forgot about your part.

Can you please post your description here, and whom ever updates the 
site will include both.

I'd like to have an announce push out before the end of the day.

Can you give me a small, 2-3 sentence description of the talk. Think 
something you'd find in a Convention program listing. That will go on 
the website and email.

Make was written to avoid the problem of recompiling files that hadn't 
changed. It of course introduced a new set of problems , such as 
verbosity, and the solutions for them.  Those solutions in turn 
introduced another set of problems such as redundancy, and so on. Maven 
is one of the moderately successful attempts to solve most of them.

Sounds like a plausible plan.

I have often been gone from town, already, when such a meeting has taken
place, so
we have pretty much always had the December exec meeting be a holiday
get-together with no group business.

Yes, although it Hoye with an 'e'.

He had used the following Title and Description when he gave this talk 
at FSOSS. I sent him an email back on Sunday to confirm this is what he 
wants to use, but haven't heard back. I sent another follow up today.

Social Engineering: Building A Community On Purpose

     Community building in Open Source is usually "organic" - meaning 
"accidental, unsupervised and messy". The bazaar has matured a lot in 
the last twenty years, though, and now we know a lot about how we can do 
better. Mike Hoye, Mozilla's Engineering Community Manager, would like 
to tell you what works, what doesn't, and why that's important.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for confirming. The projector is VGA, but we do have a HDMI to

Looking forward to seeing you January.

You can access the channel now and ping the bot (type `gtalug ping`
and it should reply PONG).

Let me comment on gtalug.info...

We knew we were planning to do some "surgery" on gtalug.org, and wanted to
have a sort of "scratch domain" to use to get a dry run that looked
realistic.  (Notably, we wanted to shift registrars, and there's enough in
the process that there was a certain amount of risk of outage that we
wanted to avoid...)

Hence, I registered gtalug.info, and we made sure it was there and in good
order before repeating processes on gtalug.org.

If there is a desire to mess around with a domain, gtalug.info is perfectly
good for that purpose.  We've had it resolving similarly to gtalug.org, but
that shouldn't be depended on, and there's merit to having it attached to
something that looks all "under-construction-y" so people don't trust it to
be front-line ops.

Is today's meeting going to be via irc or in real life?

Also who is attending? Is it worth even having a meeting. The December
meeting has been traditionally the Christmas party as well, and since that
isn't happening, is there anything in the agenda?

I have set up an agenda which assumes things are via IRC
https://github.com/gtalug/board-meetings/blob/master/_posts/2014-12-22-agenda.org

Traditionally, it is common for some people to have already left town, and
yes, indeed, the meeting has commonly been replaced by Drew's Christmas
party (and mistaking Drew's Christmas party for GTALUG's Christmas party
has been a troublesome thing).

There's not vastly much on the agenda, nothing enormously urgent, to my
mind.  So it would not be utter disaster if it didn't happen; normally this
December meeting doesn't really happen.

I don't see any good reason to meet, unless there is an urgent issue 
waiting for resolution (;-))

gtalug.info is climbing in search results.

On bing, (sorry everyone), a search for  "Gtalug code of conduct"
brings up .info, while .org doesn't appear at all.

Duckduckgo still has gtalug.org on top, but .info is the 3rd result.

Google's more sensible.

Would robots.txt solve this short-term?

Hello everyone,

Sorry I won't be able to join the meeting.

I have some work-related things I need to finish.

Alex.

Hmm, that's quite interesting.  Perhaps someone linked to the COC
page with an .info-based URL.

I expect that putting in robots.txt would eliminate both sites, as
gtalug.info is, I think, used as a CNAME, so robots.txt would wind
up blocking both places.

CNAME is not an issue if the webserver just has a different virtual 
server for gtalug.info. Http is not dependant on the DNS name, it 
explicitly requests the domain in the http header.

We can then have the gtalug.info domain return a "303 See Other" code to 
gtalug.org.

So I'm going to call yesterday's irc get together a failure.

If we plan to do this in the future, we need to organize a little more.

Can everyone try to get a client that works and log in.

I think irc or something similar is the way to go, but I think we need to
make it work first.
