This newsletter lurched to a start about a month ago.  I'll forward
these to operations as they appear.

Two things on this one - the first is the comment period for the
stewardship transition, which I'm expected to mention.  

The second is the picture at the bottom of the page.  This was taken at
the London conference.   At the far right of the picture you'll find
Evan and next to him, Scott.   The fellow in the yellow shirt next to
Scott is Alan Greenberg.
