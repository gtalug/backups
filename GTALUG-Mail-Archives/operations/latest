Quick look:

  - Google Maps
  - "sign up for our newsletter" pop-over
  - ad for mobile app
  - "you're feedback is important to us, it will take 1 minute" pop-over

Otherwise great app, will make a point to remember it, but it's not keeping in the group's character regarding open data and free software.

I suggest we announce that this is happening (tonight?) and encourage our
membership to see if there are any relevant volunteering areas.

Paying to make it happen might be out of scope, but helping is surely a
good idea.  And if people are sufficiently excited, perhaps the scope of
assistance might need to increase.

I thought of bringing some veggies & soda.

I'm kind of worried about the weather forecast[1]. It calls for a 50%
chance of rain in the afternoon. Do you think we should announce a
rain day or an alternative location inside in case we get rained out?

I remember one year (when it was across from the LinuxCafe) we went to
a cafe. We could go to the Rhino that close.

It's not a great location for me, but I missed the meeting being too busy.   The new job is a bit crazy.

Alternative venues are hard to find, I should just plan to drive over, I don't think it's a bad spot for parking, and the time is good for traffic.

Anyone need a lift from around Jarvis and Carlton to/from hacklab?  I could carpool.

For my part, it's a bit less convenient than previous locations, but I
don't feel very grumbly about it, and I like the meeting room quite well.

It troubles me that we're seeing little attendance from folks that aren't
directly officers, that suggests to me that it's not so well-liked.

+1 on the room.  It's been a great room.

For my part, it's a bit less convenient than previous locations, but I don't feel very grumbly about it, and I like the meeting room quite well.
It troubles me that we're seeing little attendance from folks that aren't directly officers, that suggests to me that it's not so well-liked.

I agree with Mike here - it is a great room.   And, frankly, I like the
place.

The location is a travel time consideration for me, but it's not a
show-stopper most times. 

Sometimes, though, there are other obligations keep me from attending,
and the travel time factors into that.

The combination of location and time together stop me, as I normally eat 
at home on Mondays and can't get home, eat and all the way back in time.

Staying downtown for dinner on meeting days gives Joyce a break, so I 
may switch to that for board meetings too: I just usually forget until 
the day of the meeting, then forget again until next month, etc...
