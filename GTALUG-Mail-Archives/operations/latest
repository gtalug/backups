If anyone has some free time the following should get tackled soonish:

1) We need to put something on the website saying that your first message will be put in a moderation queue before you are allowed to post to the list, this is to prevent spammers. If someone could draft this up it would be really helpful. The page's source is located here: <https://github.com/gtalug/website/blob/master/pages/mailing-list.markdown>.

2) A couple of people have complained about the lack of a SSL certificate on the GTALUG.org web site (we do ask for a password with mailman sign ups). Could someone research how we could do this for free. Will this need to be renewed annually? Can a self-signed cert be okay? etc.

Cloudflare has a free https option that I believe would support our needs.
It depends on SNI, but that's supported by all modern browsers / tools.
Plus on top of that, you get a free CDN and SPDY (a/k/a HTTP/2's
predecessor) support.

A two-hour window is allocated, however the actual downtime can be much less. After the maintenance, each Linode will then be booted.

Hi Myles - happy to give the OSM talk in May, then. I've presented
before, but back in the UofT days.

Any particular aspect of OpenStreetMap you'd want me to talk about?

cheers,
 Stewart

I think the last meeting was about five years ago, so we definitely need
a refresher about what issues OSM is trying to solve. Also the issues
with moving to a different open license would be interesting. We are
more interested in the philosophical than the technical.
