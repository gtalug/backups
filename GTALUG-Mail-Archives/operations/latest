This newsletter lurched to a start about a month ago.  I'll forward
these to operations as they appear.

Two things on this one - the first is the comment period for the
stewardship transition, which I'm expected to mention.  

The second is the picture at the bottom of the page.  This was taken at
the London conference.   At the far right of the picture you'll find
Evan and next to him, Scott.   The fellow in the yellow shirt next to
Scott is Alan Greenberg.

Hmm.  Why are you keen to remove it?  It means that there's at least
the hurdle that candidates need to be known by another member prepared to
'sponsor' their nomination.  That doesn't seem like a horrible hurdle to
me.  It doesn't strike me as being obviously wrong-headed.

If you have an argument to make that we face some significant
problem as result of the requirement, I'm happy to hear about it;
it's not self-evident.

I attend Carina C. Zona's DjangoCon talk remotely and she was talking
about the nominating procedures at open source non-profits and having an
appointing/nomination system usually doesn't produce a larger mixture of
people. She suggests a simple process of people submitting their name
and giving a public short speech of what they would do if elected.

I'm still trying to put my thought together and will have a better idea
in a few weeks. I just wanted to know if it was worth exploring or it
was against the bylaws.

Hey Everyone,

Do we have anything booked on Oct 13? Chris Tyler would like to give a
talk on Linux on Enterprise 64-bit ARM platforms.

Do we have standard questioner about talk description and the stuff we
put on the site?

Hi Alex,


I was just thinking about this and went to check whether I'd gotten back
to you -- and I saw that I apparently did not! My sincere apologies.


I'd be open to either Oct 13 if it's still open (or further down the
road). My talk will be about Linux on Enterprise 64-bit ARM Platforms.

I know you're gonna be busy in August, so would you be willing to give a
talk at GTALUG on Sept 8 or Oct 13?

Hey Chris,

I'm following up with the chat we had at the end of the last Raspberry
Pi meetup.

You have mentioned that you'd like to talk about a topic that is
currently under NDA, but you'll be free to give a presentation about it
after July. Which date would suit you the most July 14 or August 11 or
September 8?

We usually do either 1hr talk with 30 minut Q&A or a  1hr 30 min talk.

We're currently located at Ryerson --

*George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre* at Ryerson University

245 Church Street, Room 203 (second floor).

http://gtalug.org


Also there's a possibility that someone from the open source lab at
Seneca can give a talk about the lab and PiDora project you're working on.
We don't have anything scheduled yet beyond Jan 2015, so any month would
work for us.

Thank you,

Alex.

Hey Chris,

We don't have anything booked on Oct 13, and we'd be delighted if you'd
give a talk.

Could you write a short description 1-2 sentences of what the talk is
going to be about so we can put the description on the site --

Thank you,

    Hey Chris,

This is great, I'll post it on the website.

The talk usually starts at 7:30 pm until 9pm after which we go to a
library pub; approximately 25 people attend the talk and they are in
general linux geeks i.e. mostly programmers and sysadmins, but also a
couple of users who can install linux on their computer.

We don't mind short FSOSS plug at all, as we've been plugging it for the
last 2 or so meetings, it would be great if someone involved with
organizing FSOSS could talk about that.

Alex.

Hi Alex,


How about this for the summary?--

A new architecture has arrived! 64-bit ARM promises high-performance, low-energy, extremely dense server computing systems. This is the first time in the history of computing that a major architecture has launched with Linux as the premier operating system. This talk will discuss the hard challenges presented by the Aarch64 architecture and the opportunities it creates.

Please advise on the start time, talk length, expected audience (size/makeup), and whether an HDMI-input projector will be available. (Also, I might put in a short plug for FSOSS, if you don't mind my doing so).


Thanks--


-Chris

Hey Chris,

We don't have anything booked on Oct 13, and we'd be delighted if you'd give a talk.

Could you write a short description 1-2 sentences of what the talk is going to be about so we can put the description on the site -- http://gtalug.org/

I'd be open to either Oct 13 if it's still open (or further down the road). My talk will be about Linux on Enterprise 64-bit ARM Platforms.

Hey Chis,

I know you're gonna be busy in August, so would you be willing to give a talk at GTALUG on Sept 8 or Oct 13?

Alex.

Hey Chris,

I'm following up with the chat we had at the end of the last Raspberry Pi meetup.

You have mentioned that you'd like to talk about a topic that is currently under NDA, but you'll be free to give a presentation about it after July. Which date would suit you the most July 14 or August 11 or September 8?

We usually do either 1hr talk with 30 minut Q&A or a  1hr 30 min talk.

We're currently located at Ryerson --

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre at Ryerson University

245 Church Street, Room 203 (second floor).

http://gtalug.org


Also there's a possibility that someone from the open source lab at Seneca can give a talk about the lab and PiDora project you're working on.
We don't have anything scheduled yet beyond Jan 2015, so any month would work for us.

Thank you,

Alex.

I'm not going to be available, either.

I am going to try to get a coherent report of what ICANN's been up to
for you during the afternoon.  Or sometime.

If I can't do a coherent report, I'll send something anyway /:).
