Sounds interesting. Do you mind if I book you for June?

If that's okay I can send out the announce messages today.

Thanks to Scott we now have access to the old server.

I did an archive of the old executive notes and added them to the GitHub
repo:
<https://github.com/gtalug/board-meetings/tree/master/_old_meeting_notes>.
Hopefully I will get a huzza from Chris :-).

Also I found our old Guide to Presenting at GTALUG page and put it up on
the new wiki: <https://wiki.gtalug.org/guide_to_presenting>. Please
review as I would like to send it to June's speaker.

I just pulled the entirety of the old MediaWIki instance, as well as the
material from the Executive wiki

https://github.com/gtalug/legacy-wiki-extract/commits/master

It's now all "fodder" to be rewritten as a static site.
