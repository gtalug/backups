I snagged a photo of the building fireplan.

This came out rather ugly.   I should probably re-draw it from scratch.

Can somebody confirm that it's really room 211?

Thanks,

Mike

Yep, I've updated it further, moving TODO items in from last month, and
adding a few bits of additional business that I have been apprised of.

Those planning to be there should take a quick peek through last month's
material, in particular the last section, entitled "Action Items", to see
if there's anything you need to do before the meeting.
