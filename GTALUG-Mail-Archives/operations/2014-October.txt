Subject: [GTALUG-Ops] Ballot forms
Message-ID: <CAA3RLT5_V9p4CE=BsbW0eatoxAtBWfSnGDdDnZu8BW0KPBwCCw@mail.gmail.com>

At the last exec meeting someone mentioned that we had ballot forms with
our logo on it.

I'm not sure if this was a wish list option or the real thing. If its the
real thing can someone send the soft copy to me so I can print up a bunch.
If this was a wishlist item then does anyone have a soft copy of the logo
for me. I will create the ballot and we can archive it via git.

I don't think we have a copy of the ballot forms.

Here is a copy of the logo: <http://gtalug.org/static/img/gtalug-logo.png>.
