At the last exec meeting someone mentioned that we had ballot forms with
our logo on it.

I'm not sure if this was a wish list option or the real thing. If its the
real thing can someone send the soft copy to me so I can print up a bunch.
If this was a wishlist item then does anyone have a soft copy of the logo
for me. I will create the ballot and we can archive it via git.

I don't think we have a copy of the ballot forms.

Here is a copy of the logo: <http://gtalug.org/static/img/gtalug-logo.png>.

Hey Myles,

I'm going there( I already bought my pass), I can participate if you get a
stand.

How much do you think it's gonna cost? I don't know how much GTALUG paid
last time.


Alex.

Back in 2011 FSOSS was trying out having community tables. I arranged to 
have Hacklab be present with a half table [1] (splitting the other half 
with GTALUG). They have not done the tables since, and looking it over, 
they are not this year either (the guy that was pushing that was only 
involved back in 2011).

[1]: http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2011/node/106


This Year:

Silver Sponsorship ($2000)

     Logo on the FSOSS website and program brochure
     2 passes for symposium
     Brochure in the attendee package

Personal Supporter ($250)

     2 passes for symposium and Speaker?s Dinner
     Acknowledgment of support in program


The 'Personal' level is reachable, but is only valuable in my mind if 
folks plan to attend and the 'acknowledgment of support' can be our 
logo. I also feel that the 2 passes should be raffled out to GTALUG 
membership instead as we did back in 2011.

I'm already planning to attend for my own reasons.

Not a 100% sure but what I remember:


The button maker was sold to David at the Linuxcaffe.




I don't think GTALUG ever owned the button maker I think we just bought the supplies for Colin to make the buttons.

I need some help approving emails on the talk at gtalug.org mailing list.

It pretty simple just read the message and make sure it's not breaking
out mailing list rules:

This list is for the discussion of Linux related issues, news,
problems, and ideas. This list is not anyone's personal soapbox. It is
not for the discussion of political, social, or religious issues, bad
jokes, personal rants or similar non Linux related discussion.
Unsolicited commercial advertising will not be tolerated. Any
subscribers who offers or requests pirated software, license keys or
cracks, and similar will be dropped from the list without warning.

If you want to help I can send you the moderator password and add you
to the list of moderators.

I was under the impression we we're not doing full moderation. There was reasonable discussion of moderating first posts of a new address to help combat spam. 

How has the list been configured?

Hey Myles,

If it's just first message -- is there so much spam?

In any case, I can check my mailbox a lot of time during the day, I can
give it a try.
