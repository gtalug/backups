Hey Myles,

I'm getting moderator messages, but I don't think you sent me moderator

I've followed up with Bob to get the updated talk description he wanted to do.

Have we had any luck finding a second speaker for the double bill?

I've reached out to a very knowledgeable colleague of mine, Justin Bull.

He sent me a note back, but I didn't make it clear it was the blurb I needed. Waiting to hear back again.

Justin is too busy with Work and Classes to put together something at this notice, although looks like I can tap him as larger speaker in two months.

So, for now I'm proposing we fill the last half of the meeting with a round the room Q and A.

Unless anyone has pulled a rabbit out of their hat, when we get Bob's description., Myles, I'll ask you to put out an announce.

-1 on the opinions.   Sometimes silence can mean that you need to confirm stuff in your personal life.  If the delay takes the decision away, that's ok, but expressing a hard neutral (0), means that you've accepted either outcome.   Maybe if we add a 'U' for read, acknowledged and undecided.  I totally get why you want a response though.  

0 for me for the Q and A

My Studebaker is in the garage with the Pinto and Edsel.

1) +1
2) +1
3) 0
We should have more distributed system, so if Myles is busy someone else
can post Meeting announcements, and since everything is public chance of
getting duplicates is pretty low.

The past talks coordinators email address was something like scott-tlug-talk at ss.org is it still running? Can we move it to speaker-coordinator at gtalug.org?

Mike is scheduled for January. We do not yet have a December speaker.

Yes the old address still works. But I am in favour of moving it.

Drew already had confirmation that the lists could go.
I saw him this past Saturday and asked again for him disable the lists.

*picks up phone*

He say's he'll do it tomorrow. He was busy with a family issue on the
