Hey Myles,

I'm getting moderator messages, but I don't think you sent me moderator

I've followed up with Bob to get the updated talk description he wanted to do.

Have we had any luck finding a second speaker for the double bill?

I've reached out to a very knowledgeable colleague of mine, Justin Bull.

He sent me a note back, but I didn't make it clear it was the blurb I needed. Waiting to hear back again.

Justin is too busy with Work and Classes to put together something at this notice, although looks like I can tap him as larger speaker in two months.

So, for now I'm proposing we fill the last half of the meeting with a round the room Q and A.

Unless anyone has pulled a rabbit out of their hat, when we get Bob's description., Myles, I'll ask you to put out an announce.

-1 on the opinions.   Sometimes silence can mean that you need to confirm stuff in your personal life.  If the delay takes the decision away, that's ok, but expressing a hard neutral (0), means that you've accepted either outcome.   Maybe if we add a 'U' for read, acknowledged and undecided.  I totally get why you want a response though.  

0 for me for the Q and A

My Studebaker is in the garage with the Pinto and Edsel.

1) +1
2) +1
3) 0
We should have more distributed system, so if Myles is busy someone else
can post Meeting announcements, and since everything is public chance of
getting duplicates is pretty low.

The past talks coordinators email address was something like scott-tlug-talk at ss.org is it still running? Can we move it to speaker-coordinator at gtalug.org?

Mike is scheduled for January. We do not yet have a December speaker.

Yes the old address still works. But I am in favour of moving it.

Drew already had confirmation that the lists could go.
I saw him this past Saturday and asked again for him disable the lists.

He say's he'll do it tomorrow. He was busy with a family issue on the

Hello Everyone,

We skimmed the subject of adding meetup group for GTALUG, and I thought I'd
bring this topic up on the mailing list.

I looked into registering a group, the costs are:

Basic - $9.99 per month, max 50 member and 4 moderators
Unlimited -- $14.99

Also we might want to thing what group name and description we should
choose.

I'm also attaching screenshoot with the registration meetup page for more
details.

Hmm, price went up nearly 2x, for 1/4 of the service.  It seems to have happened within the past year.

it used to be $70/year for a moderator who could manage and own 4 groups.  And *that* was expensive.   

we would need to gain 6 members per year to sustain, valuing the effort of maintaining it at 0.

I think under the new pricing model, it's totally not worth it... which is a shame.

If a group owner can still own multiple groups, then I think there might be something to talk about.  But it sounds like it's per group now.

We could probably get six new members a year. But the issue I see is the
50 members max. It would include people who just signup for the group
and never come.

Agreed, that seems way too expensive, and I agree with your calculus.
Yep, requires gaining 6 paying members to support this, and, realistically,
it really needs to be more than that.

 I googled the subject a bit, fees seemed to have gone up this month --
http://help.meetup.com/customer/portal/articles/1738402-important-pricing-update

At this rate creating facebook/G+ events is way more effective.

Maybe I should try it out as a 1-month thing and see if it will bring any
member to our meetings, then we can see if that's worthwhile.
