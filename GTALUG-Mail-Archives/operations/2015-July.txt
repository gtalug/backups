Quick look:

  - Google Maps
  - "sign up for our newsletter" pop-over
  - ad for mobile app
  - "you're feedback is important to us, it will take 1 minute" pop-over

Otherwise great app, will make a point to remember it, but it's not keeping in the group's character regarding open data and free software.
