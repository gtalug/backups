Quick look:

  - Google Maps
  - "sign up for our newsletter" pop-over
  - ad for mobile app
  - "you're feedback is important to us, it will take 1 minute" pop-over

Otherwise great app, will make a point to remember it, but it's not keeping in the group's character regarding open data and free software.

I suggest we announce that this is happening (tonight?) and encourage our
membership to see if there are any relevant volunteering areas.

Paying to make it happen might be out of scope, but helping is surely a
good idea.  And if people are sufficiently excited, perhaps the scope of
assistance might need to increase.

How are we on food? I don't think trello is specific enough.

I thought of bringing some veggies & soda.
