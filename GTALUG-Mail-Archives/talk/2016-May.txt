# Round Table Q&A Session

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Please discuss on the general mailing list (i.e.
<talk at gtalug.org>) where you want to go for dinner.
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact the GTALUG Board @ <board at gtalug.org>.

We should pose interesting questions here.

For example, this week I'm interested in ways finding "hidden" calls in 
Java, from reflection. I hope to remover a huge wodge of dead code, but 
some of it is secretly still alive courtesy of cron jobs that call stuff.

Sort of necromancy...

Thai on Yonge sounds like a fine idea to me; I'm quite happy to go along
with
anything that occurs; it seems unlikely to be a disaster, and could be
tasty.

Having z-Teca as a backup, which is very near to our destination, seems like
a good idea, particularly as I'm pretty sure it's still around, and it's
good
to consider testing such again.

FYI, I'll comment on Blaze Pizza; I visited once last spring/summer, and
expect it would be a plausible option.  Quite similar to North of Brooklyn,
but with more seating.  Perhaps a good plan for another month...

That's a pretty good idea.

I'll throw one out...

We've had some issues with handling email coming from Yahoo! that seems
to relate to some anti-spam mechanisms.

I am aware of colleagues that used to use Yahoo! for their mail that have
switched
to other mail services as consequence of (seeming relevant) changes in DMARC
policies.

A relevant pointer: <

Now, what I'd been hearing was *last* year's news.  After the dust clouds
have
settled a bit, what's up these days with "Yahoo vs mailing lists?"

Well yahoo pretty much says "Fuck up your mailing list settings
or don't allow @yahoo.com users to post to your list anymore":
https://yahoomail.tumblr.com/post/82426900353/yahoo-dmarc-policy-change-what-should-senders

They want the mailing list to set the From field to be the mailing list
rather than the actual sender.

I guess they have decided technical users who are posting on mailing
lists don't use @yahoo.com anyhow, so they don't care.  Or at least not
enough of them do for it to be important.

If as a sending domain owner you set your SPF and DKIM/DMARC settings to 
stop people from masquerading as your site then you will have side 
effect of stopping any mail lists that send messages as if they were 
from the poster.

Once upon a time mail was a nice friendly service where people ran open 
relays and there was no problems.
Spammers have incrementally forced mail operators to add tighter and 
tighter controls to keep their heads above water.
It may be that the next mail service to die will be mail lists.

I am in the process of clamping down on all  messages so that any mail 
stamped as from a domain that I manage should get rejected by as many 
sites as possible if the message is not from my server.

Hopefully someone will find this interesting.

I solved **The Great Unsubscribe Event of 2016** by adding
ALLOW_FROM_IS_LIST = Yes the penguin's mm_cfg.py file. It's a new option
available in Mailman version 2.1.16 that doesn't require that annoying
Reply-To workaround.

You can read more over on Mailman's documentation: <
https://wiki.list.org/DOC/What%20can%20I%20do%20about%20members%20being%20unsubscribed%20by%20bounces%20of%20Yahoo%20user's%20posts%20for%20DMARC%20policy%20reasons%3F>
(sorry
that links probably not going to work as it's impossible to share with all
those spaces).

I also subscribe to the mailing list with my Yahoo email address so I can
prevent this stuff faster.

I've tried it; it's very good, but seats at most six.

(It's where that "It's all GRK!" was, briefly: 101 Dundas E.)

Yes, kind of.

High-end GPUs have evolved towards providing computing power for
non-video problems.  But they are kind of horrible and odd to program.

That's what Cuda and OpenCL are all about: somewhat high-level
languages that can be used to program these monsters.

These have massive parallelism, awkward memory resources, few separate
instruction streams, and idiosyncratic instruction sets.

Right now the hottest application seems to be deep neural nets.
Neural nets tend to require lots of floating-point array work,
something well suited to GPUs.

There is a meetup group in town that is about GPU computing
	<http://www.meetup.com/GPU-Programming-in-Toronto/>

I haven't read it, but this article might be useful
	<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units>

PS: AMD is supposed to be close to announcing its new offerings.  NVidia's 
and AMD's new generation is the first real progress in a few years.
Previous announcements have been only incremental changes since both 
NVidia and AMD were held up by process shrink difficulties and the silicon 
fabs.

I have a soft spot for AMD since it tries hard to be open-source and it is 
local.

For general purpose computing?  No.

For specialized stuff that can be run as thousands of parallel streams
with lots of loops over massive amounts of data, especially floating
point data?  Yes.  So video compression and decompression sure, 3D
graphics sure, folding at home certainly, and various other tasks like that.
But not your x86 code running your web browser or your compiler.

Reminds me of the days when Beowulf clusters were new and people would
come on IRC and ask "How to I make a beowulf cluster?" and then be asked
"You do realize it won't make your web browser go faster, it only works
with software written to take advantage of it?" and they would go "Oh,
nevermind then".

Well bitkeeper was never open source.  Bit keeper used to allow free
use of bitkeeper by open source projects, but some people did not like
the idea of their code revision history being stuck in some proprietary
vendor's product so they reverse engineered the data format and published
tools to access it, and bitkeeper had a hissyfit and took away free
use entirely.

I suppose with the popularity of git these days, they have a lot less
business left, so going open source and relying on selling support
services might be the only way to stay relevant.  It does have some
features git doesn't have (and vice versa of course).

So going open source is totally new for them.  The past was about use
of the closed source code for free by open source projects.  Not the
same thing.

"Arch Duke Ferdinand Found Alive: WWI A Mistake!!!"

Bitkeeper found alive... Git a misteak ;-)

It is interesting how much SCM has flowered since; I would not regard it as
a mistake that people have tried various things, and had some decent
successes.

Well CVS was awful to use, but it helped a lot of people and was better
than nothing.  At least slightly.  In some cases.

Subversion may very well have been a mistake, but CVS was pretty awful,
and git did not exist yet.

Subject: [GTALUG] Scripting Inkscape, and a new font appears
Message-ID: <57332C21.3000200@gmail.com>

Hi - it was great to see a bunch of you all last night. That was a good
round table last night.

[Impatient types can skip to the end, where you get to play with a free
font I made.]

A couple of months back at the Graphics session, someone asked if
Inkscape - the 2D vector graphics workhorse that everyone seems to use -
could be scripted. We pretty much said that it couldn't. Recently, I
found out that it does support a limited form of scripting, and wish to
pass this on.

The key to it is understanding Inkscape's command verbs. These can be
listed using:

	inkscape --verb-list

These verbs map to Inkscape commands, and often have names linked to the
menu they live in (such as "FileQuit" doing what you'd expect).

I had a task I had to repeat on many files: convert all the stroked
lines to filled paths. You'd need to do this if you are laser engraving
a simple drawing, but there are other applications for this too. Here's
a command that would do this for all objects in a drawing, and
_overwrite_ the input file:

	inkscape --verb EditSelectAll --verb SelectionUnGroup \
		 --verb EditSelectAll --verb SelectionUnGroup \
		 --verb EditSelectAll --verb SelectionUnGroup \
		 --verb EditSelectAll --verb ObjectToPath \
		 --verb EditSelectAll --verb SelectionCombine \
		 --verb EditSelectAll --verb StrokeToPath \
		 --verb FileSave      --verb FileClose \
		 --verb FileQuit      input.svg

What this does:

1. Selects everything, and ungroups all objects (×3, to break up most
nested groups);
2. Selects everything, and converts all objects to paths (so text,
circles, polygons, spirals become paths, the lowest-level SVG object);
3. Selects everything, and combines everything into one path;
4. Selects everything, and converts all strokes to filled paths (so a
two node straight line 1 mm wide would become a four node filled
rectangle 1 mm thick);
5. Overwrite the input file, close it, and quit.

The process has some disadvantages:

1. It opens a window *every* *time*. You can't execute verbs without the
GUI opening.
2. You can't have another copy of Inkscape open while you do this.
3. Realistically, you can't really do *anything* at your computer until
this is done, as it's popping up windows and shifting focus like crazy.
(ssh types can say “heh!” in a smug manner now)
4. You can't set parameters to verbs.
5. It will overwrite the input file.
6. It clogs up your "File / Recent" menu with all of the files you scripted.

So, about that font:-

Years ago, Commodore made a fairly terrible little pen plotter, the
1520. Its main claim to nerdworthiness was that, until recently, its 2KB
microcontroller had never been successfully dumped. When it was finally
cracked open (details: http://e4aws.silverdr.com/hacks/6500_1/) it
revealed a rather cleverly encoded vector font. This encoding - packing
a simple but complete 8×8 plotting language into 8 bits - used only 660
bytes to describe an entire font.

With a bit of PostScript, that ugly Inkscape script up there, and
Fontforge (and its slightly less ugly-but-still-Python scripting) I made
a family of OpenType fonts from the Commodore 1520 ROM dump. You can
even use 'em on the web (if you really want to embrace that "No, Really,
I Wouldn't" aesthetic):

Have fun!

Also (nerdly) cool!

You might want to hand-tune the last few of those fonts.  They have
filled-n letters (like e and o) and i doesn't show up at all.  I suspect it
is that the rectangles you described above became degenerate, so the fill
covers more than you would want.

OpenMedia

Hi David,

I’m Soledad, OpenMedia’s Community Engagement Specialist, and I wanted 
to update you about an important development that will give you the 
opportunity to take part in Parliament’s consultations about the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) in Toronto.

As you may know, Parliament’s trade committee has been travelling across 
the country holding in-person hearings on the TPP.^1 ^2 In response to 
the limited public participation seen at the first few hearings,^3 the 
committee will now include one hour for public comment in each meeting. 
*This is your chance to participate.*

We know the TPP will strip us of our democratic rights and threaten the 
open Internet. That’s why *it’s so important that Canadians like 
yourself turn up in numbers at the trade committee’s upcoming hearings.*

This Friday May 13 (that’s right, two days from now), the committee will 
be in Toronto, and we need to show decision-makers Canadians don’t want 
this deal.

*Our friends at Unifor are organizing a protest for 10am, right outside 
the hearings at the Carlton Ritz Hotel.* If you can show up on 
Friday,**you will also be able to use the public engagement hour to tell 
the committee why you oppose the TPP, and give a voice to thousands of 
others like yourself. Here are the details:

*When*: Friday, May 13

*Where:* Carlton Ritz Hotel, 181 Wellington Street West, Toronto,

*Protest:* Be there for 10am!

*Public engagement hour: *11:45am-12:45pm

*Facebook event* 
<http://qb.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=D52i764Tf2%2F7nKeLqB2gmFibB%2Fll5DIu>

Speaking slots for the public engagement hour will be handed out on a 
first-come-first-served basis, *so be sure to arrive early to ensure 
you’ll be enabled to speak.*

If you are planning to attend and/or you want to stay in the loop, use 
this Facebook event 
<http://qb.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=zXRMEXuTfrcbFlAd1yXWtlibB%2Fll5DIu> 
to RSVP and stay in touch with others planning to come.

These consultations are our last best chance to force our elected 
representatives to listen. If you can, make sure you attend. You’ll be 
doing the Internet a huge favour.

With gratitude,

–Soledad, on behalf of your OpenMedia team

/P.S: If you’ve yet to do so, don’t forget to send your message about 
the TPP directly to Parliament’s trade committee, your MP, and Trade 
Minister Chrystia Freeland using our tool at //https://LetsTalkTPP.ca/

That was deliberate. It's what pen plotters do if you try to reproduce
detail that's finer than the pen: detail disappears. I made the demi
weight so that you could have a bold that had some extra heft yet
retained some detail in the counters.

I don't recommend using the lightest weight at all outside a CNC shop.
It has no stroke weight, so disappears on most screens. It is easy to
turn it into single strokes in most CAD packages so you can drive a
tool/pen/laser around it quickly.

(I clean up my Inkscape exports in the truly awful LaserCut for Windows
Demo, that runs nicely under Wine:
https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Laser_cutter/LaserCut/Install
 - although it's a demo, it does allow you to export DXF, and if you're
using a Rabbit Laser driven by LaserCut (like ProtoLab), it saves the
project when you exit, and the results work very well.)

cheers,
 Stewart

...particularly the grub command line switch for the cstates issue. I'm not
sure how the TAF hardware differs.

Step 2: I used the jessie netinst iso recommended by Lennart last month.
This served to remind me I should have read ahead to the wifi section and
prepared media containing the firmware (Step 1).

Rather than go back to Step 1, I tried the non-free firmware netinst iso,
but couldn't locate /sys/firmware/efi/efivars, with or without mounting.

Rather than solve the wifi issue, I switched to the stretch multi-arch DVD
iso, but it got stuck installing the core packages at around 39% *every*
time. It reminded me of one of the 4.x kernels I built on Fedora that was
incompatible with running the OS on the eMMC (system) drive.

Finally I succeeded in completing the installation using the jessie
multi-arch DVD iso (3.16 kernel). After some messing around doing things I
forgot to write down, I got a running Cinnamon desktop (I wanted GNOME but
couldn't get it off the USB stick).

I located and installed the wifi firmware according to the wiki page
instructions and connected using wpa_supplicant. I started upgrading to
stretch and GNOME, but the wifi connection would crap out every few dozen
megabytes. After many hours, it finished, and I had GNOME 3.20 (something I
never achieved on the Fedora install). I then...

- switched to NetworkManager, re-installed the wifi firmware (the latter
seemed to fix the issue of the connection cutting out)

- installed non-free firmware for intel-sound and atheros (ath3k) for my
Bluetooth dongle

- installed the t100_B.state file and used Vinod Koul's settings from
http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2015-June/094080.html
for working audio (keep the volume down for testing)

- enabled and started ModemManager *and* installed the
mobile-broadband-provider-info package to tether my phone

- started compiling the 4.6-rc7 kernel with the patches from the ASUS T100
Ubuntu Google+ community effort (
https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/117853703024346186936)... it's just
wrapping up after 25+ hours. The stretch kernel (4.5.0) and the G+ Ubuntu
kernels (4.4.8.2 and 4.4.9.1) all boot, but the machine hangs with the
jessie kernel (3.16) as soon as it hits the display manager.

Current issue: Bluetooth. I haven't tried tackling the internal Bluetooth
yet, but my ath3k Bluetooth dongle worked on 32-bit Fedora. On 64-bit
Debian it is recognized and connects, but the connection is dropped right
away. The new kernel has a patch.

Corrections and suggestions welcome.

Factory Direct is selling the Hobo Arc HD for $119 (with a coupon).

On paper, this is great hardware. It has a 10" 2560x1600 pixel IPS 
display!  Just like my Nexus 10.

The Kobo comes with Android 4.2 and is frozen in time at 4.2.2.  The Nexus 
10 gets frequent updates (but not to Andoid 6).

No third party firmware projects seem to exist for the Kobo.

So this wonderful hardware cannot be recommended.

Most Andoid devices seem to be abandoned way too young.  Nexus devices 
have a better track record.  If a device is well supported by Cyanogen Mod 
then there is real hope.

For sure. Ask me about my B&N Nook Color android tablet from 2011, that
could sort-of be rooted, but the developers lost interest. Uses a
not-quite-standard micro-USB cable too, so it could barely trickle
charge with a standard cable.

> Nexus devices have a better track record.

Except for my first gen Nexus 7. The one that came after it had all
sorts of rooting options, and even native Linux. My one? None.

These would make great little information devices with their touch
screens, but the locked-down hardware makes them so much e-waste.

cheers,
 Stewart

AFAIK, one of the developers is based in YYZ. George, you lurking on

I think that the Android device team was let go a while back.
Rakuten/Kobo still support the Kobo Android application but there is
not even a pretense of support for Kobo Arc or Vox Android tablets 
devices.  Think of the known security holes revealed since they went dark.

It's a bit sad.  I have a Vox and an Arc 7HD.

| Had you seen this?
| https://github.com/kobolabs

Not sure what that is there and what is missing.

- it includes a lot of QT stuff

- it includes the kernels for Arc10HD and so on.
  There's a claim that that is the total of GPL code
  which seems questionable (surely there is GPL beyond
  the kernel).

- some other interesting things like calibre, busybox, and more.

Interesting.  About the ereaders, not the (Android) tablets.

Useful.  Thanks.

I think that if you want to pursue this, I advise you check out the
Rakuten (if they're still the owners) and/or Kobo Japanese-language
web sites. If memory services they were always the most up-to-date and
the Japanese market got access to stuff earlier than everyone else. It
probably couldn't hurt to check Chinese web sites, also.

I'd like to think that Rakuten/Kobo would understand the importance of
continuing support for these expensive devices, otherwise, why would a
savvy customer spend money on one of these devices?

I do remember Rakuten management having really good stock market
valuation and wondered how much of that was due to the man in charge,
one of his practices was making his employees learn English. I wonder
if he's still there and if they've continued their tremendous success.
I always wonder if we could better interface with the Japanese by
studying their tea ceremony, and their culture, in general.

You're welcome.

It used to be a real chore for GNU/Linux users to update their
e-readers, not a lot of info on the internet. Surely there has to be a
fair amount of interest in doing this.

I tend to look at things a little differently.

If you want to get the maximum number of updates, get a Nexus (and even
THEY will not get updates forever, as Stewart notes. But I don't lose sleep
for the others' not getting updates (or not getting them as fast as the
tech press thinks they should).

Background: I like tablets and have a few of them, including both gen Nexus
7s, an Acer Iconia, an ancient and underpowered Ainol Nova 7, and a Dell
Venue 8 that I got for $99 at the opening of the Microsoft store in Eaton
Centre. And at work I got a Nexus 9.

Each of these has a function, though of course some have more function than
others. One is nothing more than a web-enabled alarm clock with Accuweather
and a photo frame that syncs with Google Photos. The Ainol serves a similar
function on my desk at work. One is a home media player and remote for my
Chromecast. Two allow me to experiment with Android and Windows 10 without
mucking up the others.

None of these is e-waste. Even old tablets that will never run anything
newer than Jellybean can serve real purpose; remember that they are more
powerful than many of the first computers for many of us.

I read XDA and various fora, and I cringe at the volume of complaining
about the lack of updates. IMO ... if you buy a mobile device based on what
might happen in the future, you're certain to be disappointed. Any apps
that will run on your device now will still work there in five years. Apps
yet-uninvented might not run, but a whole lot of stuff will. And maybe it's
just me, but I spend far more time in the apps than in the OS. I don't run
to root devices until I have a need to.

I will have use for my devices until their batteries die, and even then I
have the option of just keeping them plugged-in (as I do with my high-tech
alarm clocks).

My most recent acquisition is a $150 gem of a 2nd phone (as a spare and for
when I travel), a Xiaomi Redmi 3 that feels like a flagship and is
functionally about 80% there. I don't ever expect an update, so any that
comes is a bonus. It does what I need today, has the spare power to
accommodate my present apps as they mature and get more featured (ie,
bloated) over time, and that is good enough.

I guess my main point is twofold;

   - Even old "obsolete"  phones and tablets can serve a purpose

   - Updates are cool, but buy your device based on what it does now;
   planning for end-of-life before you even get the thing is needless stress

Except when they're like the Nook Color, running a walled-garden limited
Android version that the vendor has closed down their branded app store:
http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/4/11160942/barnes-noble-nook-app-store-shutting-down-march-15th

Shame; it's a nice bit of hardware.

It would be really nice if these old devices were able to run a proper
Linux, but they rely on boot blobs, so they won't.

FWIW, My only deal-breaker requirement on android is access to Google Play.
That eliminates some promising equipment (ie the Kindle android-ish
bargains) but is a long-term defensive strategy.

advice:

Prior to the latest update (within last week) I was getting FF crashing

Now, after the update, I am getting FF locking up my desktop. I need to 
do a soft reset to get going again. Very much no fun.

CPU is Intel i5, 64 bit, 16 GB ram CPU temperature app shows good numbers.

I run the Gnome shell.

I use the machine as a LAMP and SAMBA server.

I have never had trouble like this before.

Suggestions and advise requested.

Sure, what websites? Can you use chrome to get to these places?

Can you access these places from another machine/os/browser?

# Nerd Money with Warren McPherson

The outrage, the greed, the cryptography, the possibilities!

**Crypto Literacy** - a quick kindergarten class of the foundational
ideas that enable the current crop of "Applied Cryptography"
applications.

**Innovation of Bitcoin** - After a hundred failed attempts to create
digital money the innovations of Hashcash and Bitcoin Mining turn out
to be the enablers for a new internet epoch.

**Blockchains and Society** - Polarising emotional debates where
people arguing contradictory positions all imagine themselves to be
defending the little guy.

The dichotomy between open Bitcoin community and advocates of private,
permission led blockchains.

Subject: [GTALUG] example of why RISC was a good idea

<https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/google-vp9-optimization>

Intel describing how they improved the performance of the VP9 decoder for 
Silvermont, a recent Atom core.

The meat is several not-really-obvious changes to the code to overcome 
limitations of the instruction decoder.  The optimizations seem particular 
to Silvermont but the article says:
	Testing against the future Intel Atom platforms, codenamed Goldmont and 
	Tremont, the VP9 optimizations delivered additional gains.

These optimizations did nothing for Core processors as far as I can tell.  
I don't know if it affects any AMD processors.

A RISC processor would not have a complex instruction decoder so this kind 
of hacking would not apply.  I will admit that there are "hazards" in RISC 
processors that are worth paying attention to when selecting and ordering 
instructions but these tend to be clearer.

Another thing in the paper:

	The overall results were outstanding. The team improved user-level 
	performance by up to 16 percent (6.2 frames per second) in 64-bit 
	mode and by about 12 percent (1.65 frames per second) in 32-bit 
	mode. This testing included evaluation of 32-bit and 64-bit GCC 
	and Intel® compilers, and concluded that the Intel compilers 
	delivered the best optimizations by far for Intel® Atom™ 
	processors. When you multiply this improvement by millions of 
	viewers and thousands of videos, it is significant. The WebM team 
	at Google also recognized this performance gain as extremely 
	significant. Frank Gilligan, a Google engineering manager, 
	responded to the team’s success: “Awesome. It looks good. I can’t 
	wait to try everything out.” Testing against the future Intel Atom 
	platforms, codenamed Goldmont and Tremont, the VP9 optimizations 
	delivered additional gains.

Consider 64-bit.  If 16% improvement is 6.2 f/s, then the remaining 84% 
would be 32.55 f/s.  Not great, but OK.

For 32-bit, 12% is 1.65 f/s; the remaining 88% would be 12 f/s.  Totally 
useless, I think.

Quite interesting how different these two are.

Thank you for the interest. I started experimenting but the problem has 
stopped occurring after the last Ubuntu update. Elsewhere is was 
reported to be a fix to one of the x-windows libraries.

Many years ago, I used to maintain Data General Eclipse systems.  The
CPU used microcode to control AMD bit slice processors and associated
logic.  The microcode instructions were over 100 bits wide.  Now
*THAT'S* RISC.  ;-)

BTW, those CPUs had an option called Writable Control Store (WCS) where
one could create custom instructions.

Technically, that was called (horizontal) microcode.

With WCS, a customer could sweat bullets and perhaps get an important
performance improvement.  It wasn't easy.  Perhaps that is similar to
the way GPUs can be used very effectively for some computations.

My opinions:

Microcode made sense when circuits were significantly faster than core
memory and there was no cache: several microcode instructions could
be "covered" by the time it took to fetch a word from core.

Microcode can still make sense but only for infrequent things or for
powerful microcode where one micro-instruction does just about all the
work of one macro-instruction.  Even with these considerations, it
tends to make the pipeline longer and thus the cost of branches higher.

The big thing about RISC was that it got rid of microcode.  At just
the right time -- when caches and semiconductor memory were coming
onstream.  Of course UNIX was required because it was the only popular
portable OS.

The idea of leaving (static) scheduling to the compiler instead of
(dynamic) scheduling in the hardware is important but not quite right.
Many things are not known until the actual opperations are done.  For
example, is a memory fetch going to hit the cache or not?  I think
that this is what killed the Itanium project.  I think that both kinds
of scheduling are needed.

CISC losses: the Instruction Fetch Unit and the Instruction Decoder
are complex and potential bottlenecks (they add to pipeline stages).
CISC instruction sets live *way* past their best-before date.

RISC losses: instructions are usually less dense.  More memory is consumed.
More cache (and perhaps memory) bandwidth is consumed too.
Instruction sets are not allowed to change as quickly as the
underlaying hardware so the instruction set is not as transparent as
it should be.

x86 almost vanquished RISC.  No RISC worksations remain.  On servers,
RISC has retreated a lot.  SPARC and Power don't seem to be growing.
But from out in left field, ARM seems to be eating x86's lunch.  ATOM, x86's
champion, has been cancelled (at least as a brand).

Geac did the same thing.
Several years later when I was with ISG we developed a 128bit processor
that we jokingly called a VRISC processor because it had something like
6 instructions.
We were using the processor in a graphics display system.

The Geac system was originally designed with core memory where the
access times were in the range of micro-seconds and the clock speed of
the microcode in the CPU was about 4Mhz built using 4bit bit-slice ALU's
and a lot of random logic.

Microcode also helped with reusing gates.
For example coding a multiply instruction as a loop of adds and shifts.
now days most processors have ripple multipliers.

The x86 although popular is not the best example of a CISC design.
The National Semiconductor NS32000 which I believe was the first
production 32bit microprocessor.
The current x86 64bit is just the last of a long set of patches from the
8086.
I believe the last original CPU design from intel was the iAPX 432.

Intel had plans to dead end the x86 in favour if the Itanium as the step
up to 64bit but AMD scuttled those plays by designing a 64 but
instruction set addition.

A number of Risc processors still live on mostly in embedded applications..
MIPS.
ARM.
Power(IBM)

It was a shame to see the end of the Alpha it was a nice processor and
opened the door to NUMA interprocessor interconnects that just came into
the the Intel world.

I don't actually know what their hardware advantage was, if any.
Perhaps they understood transaction processing better than designers
of minis or micros.

If you were interested in hardware in those days, that was an
attractive approach.  But if you were really interested in supporting
credit unions and libraries, I don't see that this was a good use of
your energy.

(I did know Gus German before GEAC.  Interesting guy.  One of the
original four undergrads who wrote the WATFOR compiler (for the IBM 7040/44).)

Some of the original RISC machines had a "multiply step" instruction.
You just wrote a sequence of them.  The idea was that each instruction
took exactly one cycle and a multiply didn't fit that.

Every processor benefited from that.  I guess RISC processors had
more regularity and that made the design cycle take less engineering
which in turn could improve time-to-market.  But Intel had so many
engineers that that advantage disappeared.

But there was a point where all or a RISC CPU would fit on a single
die but a comparable CISC CPU would not.  This made a big difference.
But we passed that roughly when the i386 came out.  Of course Intel's
process advantage helped a bit.

It sure wasn't the first if you count actually really working silicon.
I have some scars to prove it.

Yes, but the amazing thing is that the i386 and AMD patches were
actually quite elegant.  If I remember correctly, Gordon Bell said
roughly that you could update an architecture once, but after that
things get to be a mess.  I'm impressed that the AMD architecture
is OK.  I'm not counting all the little hacks (that I don't even
know) like MMX, AVX, ...

i860? i960 (with Siemens)? Itanium (with HP)?

Yeah.  It kind of pulled an Intel.  The AMD architecture filled a
growing gap in x86's capability and was good enough.

One of Intel's motivations for Itanium seemed to be to own the
architecture.  It really was unhappy with having given a processor
license to AMD.

I didn't mention MIPS.  Mostly because they seem to be shrinking.
Most MIPS processors that I see are in routers and newer models seem
to be going to ARM.

If I remember correctly, some Alpha folks went to AMD, some went to
Sun, and some went to Intel.

Intel doesn't have all the good ideas even if it had all the processor sales.

AMD's first generation of 64-bit processors was clearly superior to
Intel's processors, up until the Core 2 came out.  AMD still
lost to Intel in the market.  It's sad to see AMD's stale products now.

I think that ARM's good idea was to stay out of Intel's field of view
until they grew strong.  Intel had an ARM license (transferred from
DEC) from the StrongARM work.  They decided to stop using it after
producing some chips focused on networking etc. ("XScale").  They sold
it to Marvell.

There were and are a lot of architectures in the embedded space but
ARM seems to be the one that scaled.  It could be the wisdom of ARM
Inc. but I don't know that.

The Geac history that I was told went.
Geac used HP minicomputers.
Mike Sweet designed a disk controller that was actually faster and
smarter than the HP mini so they took that hardware and just built their
own computers.
The 8000 was a 4 processor system but the processors each served
specific functions(Disk,Tape,Comms,CPU).

The thing was to support small banks you needed a system that was close
to IBM mainframe performance.
So you could be an IBM VAR or ?????

This was in the 1980 time frame and at that time Geac had a system that
could run a credit union and was about the size of an IBM communications
concentrator.

Geac had a lot of good technology but got caught up in a second system
design and kind of got Osborned.

While still at Geac I was part of the group evaluating future processors.
Intel was trying to sell us the 286 and hinting at the upcoming 432.
Motorola had the 68000 and a segmented memory manager co-processor.
NS had the 16000(at the time) and plans for a paged virtual memory
manager and a floating point co-processor.

The group liked the NS design because it was clean and consistent.
All the instructions had the same addressing modes

I still have a NS32000 multibus system in my basement.
Its running a variant of V7(kind of a bsd 3.x) that we got from Bill Jolitz.

I wonder how much intel and the other partners brought to the table in
the design of the 960 ane Itanium.
My impression was the HP developed the base design as an outflow if
their PA-RISC work.

I have never been a great fan of Intel.
To me it just seemed that they did little original work and leveraged
their size and the work of others.
But that is just my personal impression.

The Alpha group were working closely with AMD close to the end and
Hypertransport technology got spun off into a separate group.
I liked the Alpha also and we had a number of them early on running
Digital Unix and Linux.

An interesting read is

On the other hand there are now a number of interesting processor
designs out there.
Some based on FPGAs like the OpenCores project and others like the
parallella,tilera, are more custom.
So hopefully new designs will not have to come from the big guys.

You might want to read "The Soul of a New Machine" for an interesting
story.  It was about Data General's attempt to build a 32 bit computer. 
This would have been the 3rd generation, after the Nova and Eclipse
lines.  I read this book back in the days when I was maintaining Nova
and Eclipse computers, so I had a bit more insight than most.

One problem with that is some customers, particularly military, were
allergic to single source equipment.  As I recall, Intel had to second
source their products because of this.  As a result, AMD, Siemens & NEC,
IIRC, all made compatible "Intel" products under licence.

64 bit has twice the registers, which for a lot of code is a huge
difference.  That is the biggest improvement AMD made to x86.  Scrapping
x87 is probably number 2.

Few of these technologies failed because of price.
One thing that will put several nails in the coffin of a processor is
not having a windows port.
Another is having a proprietary OS.

That sounds more like the opposite of RISC.  Much more like VAX or
mainframes used to be as far as I know.  Maybe even VLIW, although
probably not.

Now being able to define new instructions using low level RISC features
might make some sense, although how much the savings would be in execution
time or binary size I don't know.  I have a hard time imagining much
gain there.

But x86 internally has been RISC since the Pentium Pro with an instruction
decoder to convert the x86 instructions to the internal format.  Now I
suspect it might not be pure RISC, but then again neither is ARM or
probably anyone else these days.

Maybe.  And even though it flopped they still insisted on trying such
a design in the Itanium again.  And again it flopped and didn't work.
When will intel learn that compile time scheduling is NEVER going to
happen in general purpose use?

The Itanium being an awful design probably did most of the damage.

Well IBM in the server and HPC market, Freescale (well NXP now) in the

Unfortunately a case of horrible management and being too worried about

mind hurting it at all.

I also used to work on VAX 11/780 systems back then.  With the VAX, the
microcode was loaded from an 8" floppy at boot.  There were occasional
updates for it.  I suppose one could also write custom instructions for
the VAX (BTW, I'm not an anti-VAXer <g>).  I said "RISC" because the
core of the CPU was bit slice processors, which were very simple
devices, providing basic arithmetic & logic functions and the microcode
controlled them, along with some glue logic.

I was thinking it might be used for specific areas.  For example, many
years ago, computers were built for business and ran COBOL or for
science & engineering, with FORTRAN.  Back then the technology was so
primitive that what we now call a general purpose computer was not
practical.  So, there may be some instructions that could be added for
better performance in certain applications.  Incidentally, a few years
ago, I read a book about IBM's early computers and the design decisions
made for business vs science/engineering computers.  Back then business
computers worked with some form of decimal digits, but S&E used floating
point.

I think it depends if you consider those designs "original".

Well unlike intel they did actually clean up a bit while extending
the size.

Well if they hadn't done that, then IBM would almost certainly not have
used them in the PC.  So instead they would probably have gone with
the M68k.  Too bad for us intel did license it.

We can thank the Alpha team for hyperthreading, QPI (and hypertransport),
and a number of other goodies.

The netburst architecture was a stupid move by intel.  They assumed they
could increase clock rates to 10GHz+ and designed an architecture that
required doing that.

Actually they still have it.  They some some of it to Marvell.  Intel sold
the PXA line (application processors) but kept the IXP and IOP line
(network and I/O processors).  Of course these days intel also owns
Altera which is putting arm cores in FPGAs.

Or just a bit of dumb luck.  They did seem to realize that making
computers and chips was the wrong market to be in and that selling
designs and licenses was a much better business plan.  The initial
design was as far as I know just a case of seeing a CPU design house,
reading an IBM white paper on RISC, and deciding "Well we can do that too"
and then doing it.

The real laugh is that RISC processors most often have more instructions
than CISC processors.

Can you consider the JVM a CISC machine?

Power, MIPS and Alpha all ran Windows NT 4.  Itanium ran XP and Server.
Didn't seem to do any of them any good.

ARM did not run windows until Windows CE and Windows RT.

The Alpha was very early on with Windows the DEC and MS guys were
working closely (I had dealings with both at the time) but MS dropped
the Alpha and there has been some suggestion that that decision was
externally influenced.
Up to the point of being dropped the Alpha looked like it was going to
make a go of it.
They had a couple of external manufacturers of the chipset and they were
tightly involved with AMD with Hypertransport.

I believe that the Itanium died because it could never quite deliver on
the performance that it promised.
That and the fact that AMD came up with the x86_64 which would run 32bit
windows just fine and would work with the existing software.

I can't comment much in Mips or Power.

Arm  got a big shot in the arm(pun intended) when it got windows ports
because there are a lot of people using embedded windows and then the
arm became open to them as a platform.
But I think the biggest thing for ARM has been the cell phone and
tablets, most of which do not run windows but linux or some RTOS.
Intel and AMD have been rushing to fill in that gap with smaller processors.


I did not say the windows would guarantee success just that it helps in
a significant way.

When I was at IBM, in the late 90s, there were some Power systems
running OS/2.  I don't know if it was ever sold.

Actually, OS/2 lasted for quite a while in the financial sector because
it was far more stable than Windows.  It ran the ATMs for many years and
was also used in point of sales systems (the servers, not POS
terminals).  Another thing it had with Warp 3 and later was excellent
networking support.  It included many things that MS charged extra for
with NT.  I seem to recall with NT, you had to pay for the server
version according to how many users you were planning on having.  This
didn't happen with Warp Server.  I even recall a demo, where you could,
for example, share Novell Netware servers with someone who wasn't
running a Netware client.  This was done by mounting the Novell file
share on the Warp Server and sharing it from there.  Back then, even
basic telnet and ftp servers were built into OS/2, but were extra cost
with NT.  When I was at IBM, I set up an ftp server on my own computer,
where I could find files, when helping someone with there computer.

I remember hearing that Imperial Oil used it a lot (from someone
having to deal with migrating away).

Technical qualities might not have mattered.  Banks and big oil
companies computerized early and they seemed to be infected early with
the idea that IBM was always the safe choice.

They also bought into Token Ring for a similar reason.  Yet the open
ethernet standard and marketplace one.  It was just hard for central
planners to handle.

I was annoyed at OS/2 because it was announced long before it
was reasonable to use it.  UNIX was ready and able to do the job but
the earth was scorched by these promises.  Of course it looked safer
to wait for IBM and Microsoft (the old reliable AND the young turks).

This is an echo of the lawsuit that CDC brought against IBM in the
1960s.  CDC had supercomputers but sales were blocked by IBM promises
that were put off and then never actually delivered (hear of an actual
IBM/360 model 60 or 70?  The model 90 was poor and soon replaced.
Before that, Stretch (7030) was a failure too.).

It is a bit like the Itanium.  Most of the RISC processor workstation
vendors folded (or were folded) when the Itanium loomed.  In actual
delivery it was a bit of a squib: late and slow.  This bought time for
the x86 to get good enough so that it won.

Token ring had advantages over coax or hub Ethernet networks with
collisions.  Switches eliminated those advantages.

BTW, I recall trying and failing to get Linux working on a microchannel
PS/2 & token ring.  I was able to get it going on a ThinkPad with token
ring card, but it required a minor change to a config file.  I was using
Mandrake at the time, IIRC.

Your mentioning it reminded me that, In previous lives, echo "" | lpr &&

Did the printer show up when you wirelessly added it in CUPS, or did you manually add it using the known IP?

Maybe CUPS doesn't see it.

Wiki page here:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingPrintingProblems

Relevant part of wiki:

Open a terminal/console and run the commands: 
$ ping <IP of the printer> 
$ nmap <IP of the printer> 
Replace "<IP of the printer>" by the printer's IP address. The first command checks whether you can access the printer through the network, the second shows which port numbers are used by the printer and through this which protocols are active (80: Has web interface, 139: SMB, 443: encrypted IPP or encrypted web interface, 515: LPD, 631: IPP, 9100: JetDirect/AppSocket). Install the "nmap" package if needed.

Run the commands: 
$ /usr/lib/cups/backend/snmp 
$ sudo /usr/lib/cups/backend/dnssd 
The output shows whether the printers get found by CUPS or system-config-printer and with which device URIs and protocols.

Run the command 
$ /usr/lib/cups/backend/snmp <IP of the printer>
if a printer does not get found by the simple "/usr/lib/cups/backend/snmp" call.

Find out if your printer gets detected by CUPS: 
$ lpinfo -v

I can't recall if CUPS found the printer, or I entered it. I have been 
living with this problem for a while.

I ran the tests.

I do not have DNS running, so those commands failed.

The other commands worked as expected.

Results of lpinfo -v:

network socket
network http
network ipp
network ipp14
network lpd
serial serial:/dev/ttyS0?baud=115200
network https
network ipps
direct hp

The first command checks whether you can access the printer through the network, the second shows which port numbers are used by the printer and through this which protocols are active (80: Has web interface, 139: SMB, 443: encrypted IPP or encrypted web interface, 515: LPD, 631: IPP, 9100: JetDirect/AppSocket). Install the "nmap" package if needed.

lpd sounds like a wired connection (if that is the IP for your printer).

Running 'lpinfo -v' on my machine with a wireless printer I get:
network ipp
network ipp14
network socket
network ipps
serial serial:/dev/ttyS0?baud=115200
network http
network https
network lpd

network dnssd://URI_with_printer_name._printer._tcp.local/
network socket://192.168.0.109

In the printer configuration I have Device URI set to "ipp://192.168.0.109". 
Check the Device URI entry you have set.

No. This is wifi. But in the router DHCP table I have linked the printer 
MAC address to IP 192.168.0.20

I don't see where to set the Device URI. I am looking in the CUPS web 
interface to set/modify a printer.

I'm going to do the unthinkable: throw out a working notebook tomorrow.

An NEC Versa SX from 1999.
Running Fedora Core 1.
Pentium 2 @ 233MHz
256M of RAM
10G HDD [an upgrade from something considerably smaller]
Video: Trident Cyber 9388
Screen: 1024x768.
No built-in networking (that's what PCcards are for).
Swappable bay for CD writer and floppy drive (I have both).
Came with a Windows NT 3.5 license (if I remember correctly).
but with Win98 installed.

The video is a problem: it is only "TrueColor": 16 bits/pixel. The X 
driver has a long-standing bug where at each power-on the video might be 
in a state where the colours are screwed up.  The only cure is to power 
cycle.  The fundamental problem is that X doesn't know how to fully 
initialize the device.  Kind of 50/50, if I remember correctly.

I'm playing with it now.  The screen is bright and clear.  I quite like 
the feel of the keyboard.  There is a constant fan noise.

The machine was quite nice for its day but things are mostly better 
now.  I bought this 17 years ago, lets say 8 doublings by Moore's law.
Current nice notebooks vs this:

RAM: 16G (2^6 better)
SSD/HDD: 256G vs 10G (2^5 more capacity but a lot faster)
HDD/HDD: 2T vs 3.2G (2^10 more capacity and a bit faster)
screen: 3200x1800 vs 1024x768 (2^3 better)
CPU: 2.4GHz vs 233MHz (2^3 faster clock but more instructions/second too)

So: Growth is impressive but Moore's law doesn't seem to have applied.

Well that's hardly high end by todays standards, although probably still
higher than typical.

> SSD/HDD: 256G vs 10G (2^5 more capacity but a lot faster)

Might be more fair to compare the 10G against the 2T and the 3.2G against
the 256G.

But how many cores and how much cache?  That's probably where the
transistors have gone.  After all 4 cores are common, so that alone is 2^2
extra, and a modern 2.4GHz is probably more than 2^4 times the performance
of the 233 Pentium, so I would say a mid range quad core these days is
easily more than 2^6 times the top of the line Pentium ever made.
Not 2^8, but still.

Well, it only applies to transistor density, not performance.

What, Hugh throws a computer out? Noooooo!

If it has a parallel port, I know people who use computers of a similar age
for real-time control in art and music shows. FreeDOS seems to be the OS of
choice for those lovable weirdos.

Then again, I was at a retro computing meetup the other week where someone
demoed a perfectly working Friden 132 calculator from the mid-60s. It had
an acoustic delay line for memory, and the keyboard physically locked while
calculating.

Cheers

Does the printer setup page/screen have an IP address that matches your
assigned 192.168.0.20?

It might also be worth installing Avahi. The printer should auto-discover
when you open the add printer dialogue.

The IP address is saved in the configuration. I don't think that finding 
is the issue. I will park this for now. Also I am not running a DNS.

In Linux Mint 17.2 use the system menus and select System -> Administration 
-> Printers. You then right click icon for the printer in question, and 
select Properties. The Device URI will be on the dialog box that pops up 
under the Settings section.

I am using Gnome, not Mint.

My menu goes Applications > System Settings > Printers

I click on the Printers icon and see basic read only values.

The IP Address is given as localhost.  :(

I went back to the CUPS admin web interface and confirmed that CUPS has 
the printer IP as 192.168.0.20:515

If it has a parallel port, that will be *really* attractive for running a
CAD-CAM milling machine. The demand on the machine is minimal, so just
about anything from a 486 system on will work just fine.

I recently rebooted my Debian desktop, and there is no working network
now.  Networking has "just worked" for so long that I am at a loss as to
what to do.

I haven't changed /etc/network/interfaces in forever, but ifconfig -a shows
that eth0 is not being configured, and if down eth0 confirms it.

I tried fiddling with the Network Tools thing in Gnome, but it hasn't
changed anything.  Did I miss a change to how this is done and need to
learn a new approach?

Thanks!

Hi William,

Check   /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules  against your eth0's
MAC address

Half a dozen times bitten...

Thanks for the tip.  Sadly, the MAC address is in there correctly.

Do you have a fairly explicit setup in /etc/network/interfaces, or did
the helpful-but-rather-secretive Gnome Network Mangler offer to do
everything?  I tend to set up wired Ethernet explicitly, but let Gnome
or whatever have its way with a wireless interface, if applicable...  At
least it stays out of the way if you have specified a system-wide
network setup.

I have always set up networking in a text file - very explicitly.  I
thought that something Gnome-y had wormed its way in there and
"helped".

However, I have a partial solution - I ran an "ifup eth0", and I have
a network again.  What I wonder now is why isn't that happening when I
boot up?

That is odd. udev is correct, network/interfaces is OK.  Perhaps it's
time to look over the logs, or poke through /etc/rc?.d/ and /etc/init.d
to see if anything has gone astray.  Again, my experience of Network
Manager, whatever its foibles, has at least stayed out of the way of
whatever I had set up in network/interfaces.

This is why the truly paranoid just set up /etc/ as a git repository...

This is also what you get when systems have uptimes reaching hundreds of
days, as opposed to needing to reboot every hour or two.

Cheers,
Mike

Hi William,

Try sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces, then add auto in front of eth0
if it is not already there.

Mine look's like this:

aruna at debian:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Or you can add the command ifup eth0 to your rc.local file at /etc/rc.local

Aruna

Freegeek on Sudbury St usually has some older computers pre installed with
Ubuntu. I don't know the current pricing but a few years ago I paid 35$ for
a perfectly serviceable box for a friend.

Well it will if the config is in /etc/network/interfaces AND that file
says 'auto eth0' on one of the lines.

That's how debian has done it for over a decade now.

I did see one laptop loose its wired network recently.  The network device
is no longer showing in lspci, which is rather odd for an internal device.
Unfortunately being a Dell it seems it has a misfeature of doing an
rfkill on the wifi if it can't check the link state on the wired network,
so wifi can't connect either.  Pretty useless laptop at this point.

Hmm, so "Digital Comp[uter Circuits and Concepts" 1st edition from 1974,
"Electronics Techniques shop practices and construction second edition",
"Electronic Devices & Circuits" second edition it appears by Devid A Bell.
But that white one...

I think it says "Introduction to ..." but no idea what.  All the other
books are from 1974 to 1980 era.

The white one I think is Introduction to Microcontrollers

Maybe the picture is a picture of a die from a microcontroller.

Better resolution on those pictures would have helped. :)

You didn't specify if you wanted a desktop or laptop, although I don't
suppose it matters in the context of my answer (it might matter to
others).  The best places I know of to find off-lease computers is
College and Spadina: just drop into the various computer stores in the
area.  These will usually come with a fresh Windows 7, or more likely
Windows 8.1 install.

But there's some question as to whether that's the best use of your
money: for the same price or $50 more, you can often walk into Best
Buy and buy a mid-line or low-end computer that may well have the same
computing power and comes with a warranty.

If you're looking for a system with Linux pre-installed, Russell's
suggestion of FreeGeek is probably a good one - although the last time
I was in there their prices didn't go as low as he suggested, and
seemed higher than equivalent off-lease machines on College.  (This
may well be wrong: I wasn't in the market at the time and wasn't
making any kind of record of either sets of prices.)

It depends on intended use. If it's to run a specific Windows-specific app,
that will limits option. But if the intent is mainly browsing and web-based
stuff, and you're uncle isn't into geek, I strongly suggest a Chromebook.
Current tech, dead simple, inexpensive and (if you pick the right model)
soon able to run android apps.

Yeah, it's mostly for checking email, but it may also get used for
Skype and possibly other things.  I was intending to put Linux but
he's most familiar with Windows and I'm not sure his willingness to
learn something new.

The old computer is a desktop, so I don't think there's any concern
either way about form factor.

When?

In the last decade, I think that the only good prices from Factory
Direct have been pricing errors.  (I bought a tablet PC from them a
couple of months ago that I think that they mispriced chain-wide.)

When they list things that I have previously purchased elsewhere,
their refurb prices are often a bit higher than I paid for new.

 I bought a refurb HP 64 bit system a couple of years ago for about
$100, IIRC.  However, I agree, they're not what they used to be.

Absolutely.

It's alien to me, but more and more people seem to be doing mail and

tablets.

Some decent tablets are fairly inexpensive.

| Where's a good place to get a used computer for relatively cheap?  I have a

Older computers show their age in particular ways.

- laptops are less upgradable than desktops (duh)

- not enough RAM.  These days, perhap 4G is comfortable and 2G works.
  My oldest machines cannot reach 4G.  Adding RAM might be cost effective.

- SSDs are so much better for startup and some other things.  Not too
  expensive these days.  Easy to add if the computer uses SATA.  If it
  doesn't, it is probably too old to refresh.

- USB 3.  Nice.  Not necessary for casual users.

- CRT: upgrade to LCD.  I've seen 1920x1080 IPS as cheap as $100 but
  that is rare.  I guess you'd want one with a microphone and camera
  and that will likely cost quite a bit more.

- video card performance.  Really old cards don't do video well.  If
  your computer doesn't have PCIe for video it is probably not worth
  upgrading.

- OS: any Windows OS that cannot be updated to Win 10 should be blown
  away.  Some Linux would be my choice.  But pre-Win7 machines might
  well not be worth saving.

Good sources for cheap computers (but you really need to know what
you are buying):

Friends who are upgrading.

Best Buy refurbs.  But there are two clases: ones that are essentially
new but cannot be sold as such, and off-lease computers.  I would
hesitate to buy off-lease from them.  Best Buys "open box" computers
are not discounted enough.

Off-lease computers from Dell Financial Services, but only when they
have a sale (every month or two, discounts often 33% or better).
Their most recent sale was for Victoria Day weekend.  By the nature of
leasing, they are going to be business machines: unsexy but solid and
not as cheap as one would like.

Staples in-store clearance (each store has a board listing their
clearance machines)

Staples' ebay.ca store.  Seems to be empty at the moment.
<http://stores.ebay.ca/Staples-Canada>

Staples' disguised auction-only ebay store ("Surplus by Design").
<http://www.ebay.ca/usr/surplusbydesign>
Too bad the auctions usually end with high prices that show up in the
last few seconds.  Note: some a broken (that is disclosed in the listing).
I'd take a gamble on this one at $200 but I bet it goes for quite a
bit more (I can usually fix fans):

One other place that might be worth checking out is the place that takes 
donations of old computer and refurbishes them. I forgot the name of it or I 
would mention the name. I'm sure someone else here will remember.

Yeah..  Maybe I'll see if I can get him using a tablet and see if that
meets his needs.  I wish there was a computer landfill open to the
public...  I'm sure people are throwing out just what I'm looking for.

Amen to that.

I went to Community Environment Day on Saturday.  They are on most
weekends during warm weather.
<http://www.toronto.ca/311/knowledgebase/30/101000038830.html>
<http://www1.toronto.ca/City%20Of%20Toronto/Solid%20Waste%20Management%20Services/1.%20Overview/1.2.%20Community%20Environment%20Days/ced16_schedule-bring_may5-16.pdf>

They welcome ewaste but it ends up at a commercial recycler.  I'm
pretty sure it just gets selectively melted down.

If you see a computer that you'd like, intercept the donor BEFORE
they get to the stand.  If it hits the table or a staffer's hand, it
is gone.

I have rescued a small number of computers over the years.  This year
I only donated.

I talked to the senior City staffer there about actual re-use or
repair but there are some problems:

- a contract with the recycling firm.  Planning would have to start
  now for next year since contracts are awarded annually.

- no electricity for testing

- no staffing (I could imagine volunteering but a year's commitment is
  a bit much)

- (unstated but likely serious) liability issues

Notice on the second link they say:

    Donate other items for reuse:
	Eye-glasses, walking aids, hearing aids, etc. 

They would NOT accept a walker I brought due to liability issues.
