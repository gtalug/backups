When I last looked at it a year ago there were a few being worked on on the openwrt forums. They should be searchable in the Table of Hardware.

Unfortunately it very very unlikely that any will support the non-standard VDSL2 implementation that Bell deployed in Ontario.

Well, at least you don't have to worry about encryption.  ;-)

BTW, many years ago, I used to overhaul Teletype machines.  Back then, I
could type at 100 WPM, provided what you wanted typed was "NOW IS THE
TIME FOR ALL...".
(back then, they were upper case only)

Subject: [GTALUG] How can I read html email stored in Maildir format?
Message-ID: <20141101023049.GA19776@waltdnes.org>

  My 7-year-old modem/router is starting to occasionally get flakey, so
I ordered a new one from Teksavvy.  Canada Post sent a tracking update,
and it was unreadable in mutt, not to mention that 90% of the email was
graphics...

-- Mutt: Attachments
  I     1 EM ALERT Form         [text/html, quoted, utf-8, 24K]
  I     2 filename.BMP                [image/bmp, base64, 109K]
  I     3 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     4 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     5 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     6 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     7 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 36K]

  I copied the email to a text file, consulted with "Mr. Google", and
found the sed invocation to turn it into something that Firefox could
read.  According to the tracking link, the modem/router has been
accepted at Chatham and is now on route to Richmond Hill.  Since I live
in Vaughan, that means I'll probably have to pick it up at a depot
somewhere.

  Anyhow, back to topic... what apps/programs are capable of *DIRECTLY*
reading HTML mails that are stored in Maildir format?

  A possible compromise... ask if they have any router/modems that allow
you to access a CLI.  Once you have that level of access, you can
probably tweak firewall rules, etc, at will.
