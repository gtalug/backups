When I last looked at it a year ago there were a few being worked on on the openwrt forums. They should be searchable in the Table of Hardware.

Unfortunately it very very unlikely that any will support the non-standard VDSL2 implementation that Bell deployed in Ontario.

Well, at least you don't have to worry about encryption.  ;-)

BTW, many years ago, I used to overhaul Teletype machines.  Back then, I

Subject: [GTALUG] How can I read html email stored in Maildir format?
Message-ID: <20141101023049.GA19776@waltdnes.org>

  My 7-year-old modem/router is starting to occasionally get flakey, so
I ordered a new one from Teksavvy.  Canada Post sent a tracking update,
and it was unreadable in mutt, not to mention that 90% of the email was
graphics...

-- Mutt: Attachments
  I     1 EM ALERT Form         [text/html, quoted, utf-8, 24K]
  I     2 filename.BMP                [image/bmp, base64, 109K]
  I     3 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     4 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]

  I     7 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 36K]

  I copied the email to a text file, consulted with "Mr. Google", and
found the sed invocation to turn it into something that Firefox could
read.  According to the tracking link, the modem/router has been
accepted at Chatham and is now on route to Richmond Hill.  Since I live
in Vaughan, that means I'll probably have to pick it up at a depot
somewhere.

  Anyhow, back to topic... what apps/programs are capable of *DIRECTLY*
reading HTML mails that are stored in Maildir format?

  A possible compromise... ask if they have any router/modems that allow
you to access a CLI.  Once you have that level of access, you can
probably tweak firewall rules, etc, at will.

[Scott suggests you mean VDSL2.]

I have a VDSL2 modem of a brand and firmware mandated by Bell.  Even 
though they are not my ISP.  The mandate is brutal: neither end of the 
wire actually conforms to the VDSL2 standard, as far as I know.

I don't want to use their router or wireless for a whole host of reasons.  
So I don't.  I use the thing only as a modem and have my own router (and 
separate wireless access point).  My router is actually a discarded 
notebook running CentOS 6.

I've heard a rumour that the Modem/Router/Access-point box makes traffic 
slower if it is only used as a modem.  I've not investigated because 
there's nothing I'm willing do do about it.

And another thing.  I bought a wireless router that apparently runs a 
manufacturer's hacked version of OpenWRT.  But stock OpenWRT won't run 
because there are no open source drivers for the broadcom wireless part.  
How annoying / frustrating / disgusting.

Hmm,

That's a bit annoying, especially as you would feel you supported a bunch of scams.?

What brand is it so that the rest of the group can avoid the mistake?

Hey Scott,

It's actually ADSL2+
The modem is gonna be used for an older 7mbit down/1mbit up line, so I hope
my options aren't as limited.

Then I'd just get an ADSL2+ modem without a built in router and then
use your own preferred router running OpenWRT.

New ADSL2+ Modem/Routers can be had for $20 or less. Just drop them in bridge mode if and enjoy.

I bought this:
A Netgear AC1450 (refurb).
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122615&cm_re=ac1450-_-33-122-615-_-Product&AID=10657534&PID=749547&SID=rfdcb-d725&nm_mc=AFC-C8JunctionCA&cm_mmc=AFC-C8JunctionCA-_-na-_-na-_-na>
Quite inexpensive for the resources.  It was even cheaper a couple of
days ago: an astonishing $59.99 (but I had already made the purchase).

Resources: GigaHz LAN and WAN, dual-core ARM SOC; 256M RAM, 128M NAND Flash, one USB3 and
one USB2 port, wifi: an+ac, 3x3:3.
<https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R6300_v2>

The firmware can be flashed to become another model, the R6300v2:
<http://advancedhomeserver.com/upgrade-a-netgear-ac1450-router-to-ac1750-r6300v2/>
I've done that.

Here's the OpenWRT forum thread on this device
<https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46758>
Message 24 is where I heard that the stock firmware is a version of
OpenWRT.  25 explains why that isn't good enough.  Currently it is
partially supported by OpenWRT.

I'm using it as an access point.  It is not one of my my internet
gateways.

If you search the Table of Hardware, there are plenty of device that 
list ADSL2+ hardware, but spot checks showed hit or miss for Working or 
Not Working.

I really would recommend to just pursue a good OpenWRT router and then 
hang a DSL modem off the WAN port.

Examples of Inexpensive single Ethernet DSL modem/routers.

TP-link TD-8616
http://www.tplink.ca/en/products/details/?model=TD-8616
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_1059_1060&item_id=4887159

I've used a few of these, the tend to do alright. I've had some 
intermittent issues with these on know to be dodgy phone lines, that a 
more expensive modem wouldn't run into.


D-Link DL-520B
http://ca.dlink.com/products/connect/adsl2-ethernet-modem-2/
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_1059_1060&item_id=036727

No personal experience with these, but know a handful of folks that find 
them to work well enough.

Or, like I said, keep it simple and use just an ADSL2+ modem without a
built in router so you don't have to fiddle with setting bridge mode.

I've found TP-Link products to be inexpensive and reliable, such as:

If that is just a modem, as it claims, why does it list this feature:

Does it do slightly-deep packet inspection, peering inside the PPPoE
packets?

There is a local web server to manage the thing.  Perhaps that's why
it has a firewall.

More of a meta comment...

I daresay I haven't had much luck finding devices that run OpenWRT well.

I have run through the hardware support list in parallel with reading stock
lists at
local computer shops, and found, erm, "inadequate overlap."   The last time
I
bought a router, it looked like it *might* support OpenWRT, however that has
remained nascent, so I'm still running DD-WRT.

I'm a bit suspicious that OpenWRT isn't sufficiently supported by "staffing"
(of whatever sort) to keep up with the normal flow of new router hardware
(there's naturally going to be new stuff, as all the vendors need to sell
something new next year).

My impression is that:

- reverse engineering is slower than new gadgets get adopted.
  Broadcom is very bad for open source.  Atheros has been much better
  (at least until it was bought by Qualcomm).

- it appears that support for NAND flash is not mainstreamed in OpenWRT.  
  Yet that seems to be the future direction of hardware.

  (technical sketch: ordinary old flash can be written a word at a
  time, kind of like RAM (but more slowly).  NAND can only be zeroed a
  large block at a time.  And NAND flash is much shorter-lived.  (But
  it is cheaper and more dense.) So you need layer of software to do
  wear-leveling and to create an abstraction that kind of looks like a
  disk.  There are several competing systems to do that.  UBI is one
  that is being adopted for some OpenWRT projects.)

- lots of OpenWRT work is itch-scratching.  It often involves git
  commits but not wiki updates.  So if you care about a device, google
  for it + openwrt.  There are often postings about work in progress,
  sometimes even completed.

- turn it around: buy hardware that is known to be good for OpenWRT.
  Unfortunately, buying stuff that does not support the latest
  standards is a bit discouraging.  The CeroWRT folks (downstream from
  OpenWRT, and very interesting) only support the NetGear WNDR3700v2
  and equivallent -- no support for 802.11ac.

  The TP-Link Archer C7 v2 looks good, cheap, and might be supported.
  Beware: the v1's wireless will never be supported; the C8 is not as
  good, more expensive, and isn't supported (it has the same Broadcom
  chip as is in my Netgear R6300v2).

	<http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500>
	<http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32498-tp-link-archer-c7-v2-reviewed>

So why did I buy the Broadcom-based Netgear R6300v2?

I was bargain hunting and in a hurry.  I read the OpenWRT thread on
the Netgear R6300v2 and didn't read to the end; it looked as if
support had just appeared.  And the raw hardware of the Netgear looked
much better than the TP-Link: 8 times as much flash, lots more ram,
much faster processor, USB3.  I failed to notice that the actual
wireless performance wasn't quite as good.

The final hook was that I was buying a somewhat cheaper model than an
R6300v2 and upgrading it by flashing.  I thought I was getting away
with something.

I had actually started with a Future Shop / Best Buy bargain on the
TP-Link C7 (for a v2, but that wasn't in the specs.) but they ran out
of stock.

The FS/BB blow-out might be a sign that the c7 is being replaced by
the inferior c8.  Get'em while you can.

I was puzzled by that as well. (I don't own this device.) Could be it
was incorrectly copied from the spec's for a combination modem/router.
There's no mention of a firewall feature in the user guide, so it's
either incorrect or something that's not user configurable. Protection
from buffer overflow/DOS attacks perhaps?

I'd /generally/ agree, but like all consumer networking manufacturing,
they'll change the hardware inside to suit their costs and not
necessarily update the name or model number. If you're running ARM or a
non-Intel Linux, that change in chipset ? no matter how small (oh hai
Realtek) ? means the difference between a working network adaptor or a
USB-attached ambient air-warmer.

So saying, I had a computer that worked solidly for many years using the
cheapest TP-Link network card and (ack bleaah) NDISwrapper.

cheers,
 Stewart

I often want the same thing (or mbox files, or ...) and the best I could
come up with was running an IMAP server on localhost (dovecot in my case)
and using thunderbird.

I think I found a few clients that claimed to deal with maildir and/or
mbox (most often the latter if I recall correctly) but was dissatisfied
with them for one reason or another.

Day to day use, I use mutt with a .mailcap file that invokes elinks
on html when necessary, and can toss it to firefox if needed (which
is more complicated when firefox is local and mutt is on a remote
machine), but that often doesn't include the images in the message
display.

Mail used to be so much simpler ...

Hope that helps!

I appear to be invisible to modern electronics as well. The faucets at
work are all motion-activated. Or not, in my case. I have to hold my
hands and wiggle them *just so* in order to get water, but as soon as
I start making washing motions with my hands the water stops. The
paper towel dispensers have also been electronicated, so it's equally
difficult to dry my hands as it is to wash them.

As I mentioned in another post, I've worked with these. The are a full 
router. You never find 'modem only' devices any more. The functionality 
for a router is so damn cheap. But they are also so cheap that you can 
wilfully waste that router functionality.

 From a design perspective you grab System on a Chip, many which come 
with two or more Ethernet devices built in, connect one of them to the 
ADSL chip-set, the other to an external jack and slap it on a board with 
some LEDs. A little software and your done.

I bought one of these this past week. I'd been periodically checking the 
stock at Canada Computers and they finally had a v2 in stock.

I gave it a once over with the stock fireware just to make sure the 
hardware wasn't DOA and then installed OpenWRT.

Here are some of my very first impressions. I only just started 
configuring it. I have only gotten this far.

1) Does it turn on, and flash easily?
2) Can I use the web UI?
3) Do my devices see the wifi and connect?

The answer to all of the above is yes.


OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)

Notes:
The web ui is a startling jump from Attitude Adjustment 12.09. The older 
UI had this sort of 'tab-like' layout. Where now the tabs are menus from 
a single top bar, everything piece of functionality under the same 
headings though. It feels like it's more friendly towards mobile 
devices, and also is shinier.

The front Wireless LEDs do not light up.


OpenWrt Chaos Calmer (Trunk/Dev)

Notes:
The nightly firmware image is minimal! The web UI (luci) is not 
included, use only if you ready telnet/ssh in and use opkg to install 
what you need. Reverted back to Barrier Breaker for the time being.


I'll have more to say on it after I switch to using this as my primary 
wifi solution.

I've finally got around to copying my mail from gmail to my home
machine.  I'm using getmail ( http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/ ,
also in the Ubuntu repos), but it barfs after collecting my 80,000
messages across six hours - and then considers the next run to be
"new" so it doesn't do collect only new mail, it collects it all
again.  And having not spotted that these are the same messages, it
duplicates them and the backup directory is now twice the size it
should be ...  I'm using IMAP, and yes, it's set to only collect new
mail.

So has anyone got getmail fully working with gmail, or does someone
have another recommended way of fetching gmail onto a local machine?
Thanks.

I'm using offlineimap with the 'realdelete no' option so I doesn't
delete the message on the remote server.

offlineimap is really cool because you can call a Python function in
it's config file. So if you didn't wanted to store your password you
could write a Python lookup function to check your Password
Manager[1]. It also allows for name translations so you can work with
Gmail annoying '[Gmail]/...' folders.

[1]: This is an example of one written for the Gnome Keyring:

I considered one of these recently.   It really has no router.

That said, for about $1 more, you can get the 8617 which looks identical, but has a router :-)

I cant recall which I bought.  Works fine so far.

Ah sorry.

I confused the TD-8816 with the TD-8616 you linked.

I've not seen the 8616 in stores.

I would bet a nice dinner that the only significant difference is software.

The closest thing to what I was looking for is TD-W8961ND, but it specs
aren't so great, (only 4MB of flash) and when I initially read installation
instructions for OpenWRT, they seemed somewhat dodgy --
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd

I ended up buying TD-8616 ADSL2+ standalone modem, it's $23.99 plus tax.


It is possible to install OpenWRT on Raspberry Pi there's pretty good
support of RPI -- http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi

I know it's a massive overkill, but in this case I don't really need
network ports, I already own several linux-friendly USB wireless cards that
can be run in Host AP mod, and of course I wanna see if it's gonna work.
I just need dig up a ethernet crossover cable, which I prematurely
relegated to be a thing of the past.

Alex.

Are you sure you need a crossover? Almost all ethernet ports are
auto-sensing these days. The TD-8616's and the Raspberry Pi's both
are.

In a wee bit of a spot :(

Have a git repo with squashed bugs coming back from the dead - and a
conference tomorrow where early adopters are supposed to be trained on
using the software.

The strange thing is that there doesn't seem to be any indication of
corruption or bad merges.  There are a few dangling commits, blobs
and trees but they don't look to be related.

Not having run into this scenario before I'm not quite sure where to
start.  Any pointers or suggestions?

Thanks,

I don't know if git-bisect would help, but I've found it useful to isolate
where a particular change took place. You might find that there's a merge
that was done in the wrong direction (it happens).

Cheers,

Alex

Thanks Alex. So far no luck - everything looks about right (but
obviously isn't) :(

Alas things get even stranger... using one of about a half-dozen
similar issues, running a recursive diff on files from both my dev and
staging environments show they are the same (same with the dataset the
code is working on - they appear to be identical), however the two
environments are not acting (sorting, specifically) the same.

Code, datasets, db servers, OS's & packages are - for all intents and
purposes - the same (dev work takes place inside Vagrant images)

In this particular case, on staging we're seeing a bug that was (and
according to the file system, *is*) fixed and QA'd to death months
ago. On dev it is acting as expected (ie. is fixed).

Some people think the way to check in file changes is to make their
changes, copy their file somewhere, then checkout the current version,
replace it with their version (without merging any other changes of
course), and check it in.  It's a great way to loose changes.

Of course people simply not understanding the merge resolution in git
can also cause things to get lost.

To verify you've got the identical files on dev and staging, you can do
some variation on

  find . -name *.pl | xargs md5sum | sort

and compare the output of that command from the two platforms. Assuming
there's no configuration information in those files that differ between the
environments, that should confirm or deny you have identical installations.

Restarting the web server meant something ten years ago, these days, not so
much.

Apart from that, try to nail down why the bug that's been solved is
reappearing -- what fix was made to solve that (it's documented in your git
commit comments, right?). Maybe go back to basics and add a few logging
lines to confirm that things are working as they should.

Good luck -- debugging is indeed a black art. :)

Check the character set: sort(1) guarantees it sorts bytes. Gnu sort 
sorts characters,
which are not the same thing, and carries the warning:

***  WARNING  ***  The locale specified by the environment affects sort
        order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses 
native
        byte values.

The Eunuchs wanted to sort lines of bytes separated by ASCII newline 
characters, 0x0A, and did.  Gnu extended this to other character sets, 
but silently changed the default.

Linus would not have been impressed (;-))

Any chance it's a C project with missing dependencies in the makefiles?
That's a classic way of checking out the right source code but having
lingering bad binaries.

Clock skew can do it too: if the machine hasn't always had stable time
then "before" and "after" become wonky.

If in doubt, make clean (and verify that doesn't leave anything that
isn't source) and rebuild all.

I don't know about the announcements, but you were in limbo since this was
the first message you sent and you need moderator approval. Its a feature.
All your emails after this should go through without a problem.

As far as I know we have a meeting tomorrow.

GTALUG meetings are at 7:30pm in the George Vari Engineering and
Computer Centre at 245 Church Street, Toronto, Ontario (Map:
http://osm.org/go/ZX6Bt7Di--?m=&way=23447525 )

A bunch of us meet beforehand in the "Love At First Bite" Suhsi Pizza
shop (Map: http://osm.org/go/ZX6B4qUC--?m=&way=23447525 ).

And a bunch of us meet afterwards at the "Imperial PUBlic Library" for
beverages and snacks (Map: http://osm.org/go/ZX6BttAv--?m=&way=23447525 )

There is much overlap between the two bunches.

- --Bob, who doesn't believe that "Sushi Pizza" is actually a thing.

Message-ID: <CAEmORor1EoBrUtiz+ZOxhL0YUCGg-h1yb+DcYZ89LOkUV=US+g@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,

Sorry for the somewhat off topic nature of this note.

My wife's employer, a computer services company in Aurora, ON is looking
for a technician to help support their clients. They need someone with PC
break/fix experience. Their OS needs are primarily Windows -- in particular
Active Directory knowledge and MS Exchange. They would probably look on
Linux experience as a bonus, but Linux is not the main job focus.

If there is any interest in this opportunity, drop me a note directly (not
through the list) and I will provide the contact information where you can
send your resume. Don't send me any resumes or personal information, as I
have no direct connection to the company or the recruitment effort, but am
just facilitating my wife's wish to make this opportunity known to the
widest possible technical audience.

Thanks,

Do-Ming Lum

Hey Bob, when you get a chance could you tar (or put in a Git repo)
your slides so we can archive them on the GTALUG server.

Subject: [GTALUG] Crypto Question: Where do you get your entropy
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1411120055080.6002@redclaw.mimosa.com>

[Scott asked that we post our questions from tonight's meeting]

Where do you get your entropy?

Entropy (real bytes of random numbers, not pseudo-random numbers) is key 
for cryptography.

- when generating keys for public-key cryptosystems (RSA, ECC, ...)

- when generating session keys via a Diffie-Hellman exchange

- challenging the other side in various ways (eg. proving liveness
  or proving possession of a private key)

- probably other cases that I'm not remembering at the moment

In many cases a Cryptographic Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is
good enough, but not these.  Sometimes a Cryptographic PRNG can be
used to "stretch" entropy: kind of like stretching soup by adding
water or milk.

Adversaries can easily break your cryptosystem if you don't have
sufficient entropy.  It's that bad.

What sources do you use?  /dev/random and /dev/urandom are the Linux
channel for entropy.  There are various sources that can be pooled by
the kernel:

- timing of unpredictable event (e.g. user keystokes, disk seek
  timing, ethernet packet timing, ...).

  The only one I kind of trust is the keystrokes thing, and that
  doesn't work for servers.  Others might be controlled by or
  predictable to foes.

  Keystrokes are not as good as one would like.  For example, USB
  keyboards have keystroke timing quantized by the USB scanning rate.

- Recent Intel CPUs have true RNGs.  (Assuming that they were not
  subverted by the US Government or something else.  Or just plain
  buggy, something that might not be detectable)

- external entropy source.

  - Scott mentioned several.  One DIY example: harvest the americium
    pellet from a smoke detector and place it directly on a camera
    sensor.  This makes a kind of Geiger Counter and Geiger Generator
    (I made that second term up).  Physicists think that radioactive
    emissions are unpredictable (except for chain reactions) and thus
    should be good entropy generators.

  - Chris mentioned a Kickstarter(?) project that has produced what
    they claim is an entropy generator on a USB stick.

On remove VMs (regardless of the the fact that you control the host node
or not), I like to use haveged to generate entropy. This is especially
helpful on Xen PV VMs where I've had issues with openssl blocking on
entropy.

Anyone know why that might be?

Not Kickstartered, from a UK-based company...

http://www.entropykey.co.uk/tech/

"The Entropy Key uses P-N semiconductor junctions reverse biassed with a
high enough voltage to bring them near to, but not beyond, breakdown in
order to generate noise. In other words, it has a pair of devices that are
wired up in such a way that as a high potential is applied across them,
where electrons do not normally flow in this direction and would be
blocked, the high voltage compresses the semiconduction gap sufficiently
that the occasional stray electron will quantum tunnel through the P-N
junction. (This is sometimes referred to as avalanche noise.) When this
happens is unpredictable, and this is what the Entropy Key measures."

Priced at 36 euros in small quantities.

Unfortunately, these are no longer available. If you check their shop, they
say that the wait time is effectively indefinite.

It looks well designed, but it all depends how paranoid you need to be.
Certain ARM Cortex microcontrollers have thermal hardware RNGs built in.
They can pump out a stream of noise at a huge rate.

The Raspberry Pi's SoC has one too. It's not super-fast and closed, so you
decide if it works for you. Most other artisanal solutions (Geiger counter
timing, clock skew on microcontrollers, detuned radios, avalanche noise,
intentionally mis-wired comparators) don't produce the volume of entropy
you need. They're also open to tampering, and most folks don't have the
knowledge to know what to look for in designing such a thing. I certainly
know I don't ...

I haven't checked if you still have to build a custom kernel to get RdRand
support on x86. Given past messes over ssh entropy holes, the lack of
support for RdRand because it might be tainted by the NSA was a pot/kettle
situation.

After 4 years my Lenovo x120e has final succumbed to the rough and tumble I put it through. The screen cracked and is unusable. This leaves me looking for a replacement.

I'm going to constrain this question to Lenovo options. I don't think I can overcome my track-point addiction. 

Anyone purchased Thinkpad hardware in the last while? I know with some of the recent models Lenovo has started messing around with the keyboard design.  What are peoples opinions?

I have a first gen X1 Carbon and love it.  It does have the usual downsides
of most ultrabooks; soldered on ram and non-standard drive, but has been
rock solid.  It has a chiclet style keyboard, trackpoint, 3 physical mouse
buttons, 1400x900 resolution on a 14" screen, on a machine that's basically
the size of a MacBook Air 13".  Linux just works out of the box.

The major issue is that the current generation has the worst keyboard
layout I've ever seen.  The Function keys are now a "smart screen" that
dynamically change to "useful" keys based on what tasks you are doing.
Even worse though is the physical keyboard layout. I'll let the picture
speak for itself:
http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thinkpad-x1-carbon-keyboard.jpg

I know that the X240 series are still "proper" ThinkPads in that they are
easily serviceable and use standard RAM and drives, but have no personal
experience with them.

Good luck!

I have a W530 and my wife has a T430 and they are both great.

On the [WT][45]40 models however they have apparently ruined the keyboard
and trackpoint completely.  There are no buttons for the trackpoint
anymore, it instead uses the touchpad to emulate buttons which, from
what I have read, people hate.

I do see that the Helix2 has gone back to real buttons again, so hopefully
that means Lenovo listened and will be going back to what people want
on the *50 models again.

I see some posts here:
https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T400-T500-and-newer-T-series/Please-Bring-Back-Physical-Mouse-Buttons/td-p/1471840/page/2
that say service reps at lenovo already said the *50 models will get
the proper buttons returned and the case will be improved again.  I guess
they do listen.  Given the Helix2 already got them back, it seems quite
likely to be true.  But the current models I would not buy.

I had a T510 which was great ( heavy but great) , I liked the keyboard ,
and the graphics card was good enough to play games. Optical drive , good
wireless, limited by power ( only got like 2 hours at best) . Linux support
was also good. Performance was good. I had a dual scren dock , and the
device could drive both via DVI.

Then I lost the 5 key and IT issued me a X240.. Lighter, newer, small
screen, nice and snappy, no optical drive, much better battery life. I feel
cramped on the screen. There are screen options. 1366 X 768 , 1366 X 768
touchscreen, and a larger one 1920 x 1080 all 12.5 inches. I have the
1366X768 non touchscreen and I feel cramped.

I have a dock for this x240.. but the laptop can't drive both screens with
DVI.. One has to be VGA. I dunno if that's a limitation of the particular
dock that I got, or if that's a limitation of the video card, but after
going Digital I can't stand VGA. Too fuzzy.

So the keyboard. I have had some trouble getting my head/hands around this
new keyboard. For one f1 f2 f3 function keys don't "work" out of the box .
They all do their "special purpose" like volume , display changing , mute
etc. I had to tell it : by default when I press the F1 key .. it send an
F1!
Also I can't get "end" to work without also pressing "Fn" . ... Which I now
call the "effin" key if you know what I mean.

Screens can be replaced.  There's a chance that it is worth the
bother.  But a E-350 always seemed weak to me.

I still like my ancient ThinkPad x61t with the high resolution screen
and ancient aspect ratio.  This x60 on Kijiji is $100.  Unlike most
x60's it has a Core 2 Duo CPU.  It won't do videos well since it has a
weak video controller.  Its screen resolution is not high-res: 1024x768:

Here's one with the high-res (1400x1050) screen but only a Core Duo
CPU for $150):

(At the previous IETF, I talked with Linus Nordberg (of TOR, among other 
things).  He uses modified x60s because they are the last model that he 
knows how to replace the BIOS with coreboot -- he wants to have 
confidence in the firmware not being bugged.)

I have an HP Elitebook with a "pointstick".  But it is an old model.  I
don't know if they still have them.  Here's a table of things with
trackpoints but I suspect that it is out of date:

If you are willing to carry around a tank, there's a chance you can
find T[45]30 unused models around.  Other than that, consider buying
used.

(Doesn't seem like a great price to me.)

We all value different things.  Current notebooks have gotten way
better in some areas that I care about: battery life, weight, screen
resolution.  I don't like touchpads, touchscreens, or trackpoints but
some versions are way better than others.

I don't think buying an used laptop is a good idea, because unlike
desktops, specifications is not the only thing you can get in a laptop,
but also how they were used -- after several trips in my bicycle
pannier, my T420 has a couple of cracks on plastic frame near screen,
utterly broken cd-rom and several non-essential plastic parts missing.

I second T430, they can still be found brand new, and even though they
bulky and Lenovo already started messing with the keyboard at the time,
it still was usable for *nix crowd.

Also get a model with t-suffix, as in T430s(lenovo really likes letter
't'), they used to be a few hundred dollars more expensive but they
supposed to be marginally more lightweight and rugged, and more
importantly, on those models instead of useless cd-rom drive you can
install additional 6-cell battery. Sourcing that battery, however is a
bit of a challenge.

If you guys don't mind soldering a lot, there's a hardware RNG here:
http://hackaday.com/2014/10/31/dual-mode-avalanche-and-rf-random-number-generator/

It says it can generate ~350kbits per second of entropy... I don't know if
it's enough for you.

If you have a Pro dock (Which has DVI, DP and VGA), you can only use DVI
_or_ DP on the dock.  The Ultra dock has a second pair of ports which
allow DP _or_ HDMI (but not at the same time), so with that dock you can
do any combo of two DP, DP + HDMI, or DP + DVI.  If you want two DVI you
need a DP to DVI adapter for the second DP port.  With the Pro dock, you
can still do that using a DP to DVI adapter connected to the DP on the
x240 itself, and the second display connected to DP or DVI on the dock.
Essentially the pro dock only has one digital connection from the laptop
to the dock, so only one of the digital ports can be used at a time.
The VGA on the dock is a copy of the one on the laptop and the one on
the laptop does not work when docked.  The DP port is seperate though.

Don't then have an Fn lock option to make it always do that instead?
Often there are bios options on thinkpads to pick the settings you like
(such as swapping control and fn if you prefer the other order).

OK, what option do you like if you don't like those 3?  Please don't
say trackballs, because no one is allowed to like those evil things. :)

/dev/urandom does not generate entropy I think. It depends on /dev/random. The firmer just stretch the later entropy.

The problem is more acute with servers though unfortunately as most run on virtualized environment these day and since there is no console, they gave little entropy during start up. ?

Thanks all that answered.

Looks like most of the current generation is a wash with that horrid clickpad. Shame too since the x240 was looking rather like what I wanted.

The x140e, still has the mouse buttons I want. But I'm tired of 1366x768.

The helix gen 2, although not on the Canadian market yet, does show a return to the trackpad and buttons. Great feature set, but the Core M processor leaves more to be desired in raw performance.


It's almost enough to consider a Surface Pro 3 paired with a compact thinkpad usb or Bluetooth track-point  keyboard.

I have the usb version for my desktop at work.

It's a tough time. Thanks again for you feed back.

Mostly touchpads, but there are a lot of differences that matter
between touchpads.

[The following long discussion might only interest me.]

The answer depends on the way I'm using the device.

Oh, and what I think I will do (when selecting a device) doesn't
always match what I actually do.  That's why I've experimented with so
many things.

All trackpointers are the same to me (usable but not great).
Touchscreens are of no use to me with a normal Linux desktop.
Trackpads very wildly in usability.

I like mice best, but the logistics are annoying with laptops.  Still,
if my session is longer than, say, a minute, it is probably worth
deploying.

For web surfing on an Adroid or iOS tablet, I quite like touchscreens.
Except while entering text.  But I've never found that touchscreens on
notebooks useful:

- partly due to the crappy support in Linux desktops

- partly because what I'm doing often involves typing

- partly because horizontally reaching for a touchscreen is very
  tiring ("gorilla arm")

- perhaps because Linux tasks require precision that is beyond
  capacitive digitizers.

I rarely remember that I'm even on a touchscreen when I'm using one
with Linux.  (My main notebook, a Yoga 2 Pro, has a touchscreen.  So
does our kitchen computer.)

Trackpointers are simple in concept but I've not really gotten used to
them because I don't have one on my desktop where I do most of my
typing.  (Or on the typewriter or keypunch where my muscles learned to
type.)  My main notebook for five years (x61t) has one and no
trackpad, but I carried a mouse.  The trackpad should be good for
touch-typists (it's in the home row).  But on my high-resolutions
screens, it takes a long time to move a significant portion of the
screen.  I've always found it a bit, well, creepy that the cursor
often drifts when I let go.

Touchpads on notebooks have a variety of designs with a variety of
good and bad points.

- I hate it when touchpads decide that I'm talking to them when I
  don't think I am.  The cursor will zing off somewhere while I'm
  typing or thinking about typing.  It may be my fault, but it happens
  much more frequently on some systems than others.  There's a simple
  fix some systems have:  ignore touchpad events while the user is
  typing.  I suspect that isn't enough.

- I am annoyed at the way touchpad use seems to require two hands
  sometimes: moving a finger on the surface while clicking or holding
  a button (or two!), perhaps even while holding a modifier key.

- having the left button being the whole pad seems like a step forward
  but on my samples, it is designed as a lever with the fulcrum at the
  top so (a) the pressure varies, and (b) is theoretically infinite at
  the top.

- I like the new gestures that have come in.  But haven't seen a
  manual.  So I'm not really confident that I know them.  The most
  useful seems to be two-finger sliding for scrolling (but there seem
  to be two opposite conventions about the direction).

- the middle mouse button is useful in X and Firefox.  It is rare in
  trackpads (except thinkpads).  Simulating by using left+right click
  isn't as reliable.

- new trackpads seem to have soft buttons.  My fingers cannot "feel"
  where they are.  So I have to look down from the screen.  On the
  other hand, if I put some effort in I could configure a middle
  button, I think.

I don't seem to use a stylus.  My x61t tablet/notebook has a stylus
but cannot sense my fingers.  I thought that would be worth trying,
but it hasn't been useful.  If I were drawing things, it would be
wonderful: precise (unlike capacitive sensing of fingers) and pressure
sensitive.  I am envious of Microsoft OneNote users, but in reality
handwriting is probably too slow.

I accepted a stylus in the Nokia tablets and the Sharp Zaurus.  But
the iPad was a real revelation: a fluid interface and not cramped (10"
vs 4").  But I perform some tasks better on the earlier tablets (ssh).

(I actually do some things in busybox on my Nexus 4, but only because
I haven't bothered figured out how to create a GUI for these tasks.
These same tasks are probably better on my Zaurus but it is usually on
the shelf, uncharged.)

[Your MUA seems to muck up linebreaks in quoting.  It also converted
some of what I typed to non-ASCII.  I've tried to fix that.]

Neither generates entropy.  That's why I described them as channels.  I 
tried to be fairly careful in what I said.

You are right that /dev/random only yields as many bytes as the
kernel estimates there are bytes of entropy in the pool and that
/dev/urandom will give as many bytes as you ask for, even if the
entropy estimate says that there is none remaining.

Entropy is a tricky topic.  Maybe this talk next Monday will be
enlightening:
<http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/fieldsmedalsym/14-15/Images/fms_po_final.pdf>
I'm thinking of going.

Good point: virtual servers are even worse off than real servers.
