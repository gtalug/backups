  No.  I have an ancient HDHR-US model.  Looking back at my archived
emails, I figure that I got it sometime around June 2010.  The output
from "get help" is...

Supported configuration options:
/ir/target <protocol>://<ip>:<port>
/lineup/location <countrycode>:<postcode>
/sys/copyright
/sys/debug
/sys/features
/sys/hwmodel
/sys/model
/sys/restart <resource>
/sys/version
/tuner<n>/channel <modulation>:<freq|ch>
/tuner<n>/channelmap <channelmap>
/tuner<n>/debug

/tuner<n>/lockkey
/tuner<n>/program <program number>
/tuner<n>/streaminfo
/tuner<n>/status
/tuner<n>/target <ip>:<port>

  According to the manufacturer's site, the latest models support a lot
more stuff, including...

/sys/ipaddr dhcp|"<ip> <mask> <gw> <dns>"

... which allows to get/set ipaddress, or work as a dhcp client.

  Interesting.  I'll keep going with over-riding the iproute2 default
and force ifconfig, as the network-utility stack.  By the time ifconfig
support is deprecated in Gentoo, I'll probably be looking at getting a
new tuner, rather than another NIC.

  Thanks for the info anyways.  Now I can stop pounding my head against
the brick wall.

Why not go with the other option I mentioned, add another NIC.  They're
cheap and you can do what you want without violating the RFC.  All
you'll need to connect the tuner is a cross over Ethernet cable.  All
new hardware might set you back $10-$15

I'm considering the Zotac and Asus mini-pcs for the basis of a home-office
system. It won't be used for gaming, just spreadsheets, word processing
and internetting. I'm looking for a box with a bunch of usb ports, hdmi
port, wired network connection. Wi-fi and a second hdmi port would be a
bonus.

Has anyone installed Linux Mint on one of these types of machines?

Thanks -

  Even easier is to include the line...

modules=( "!iproute2" )

...in my /etc/conf.d/net (probably Gentoo specific) and it keeps working
using ifconfig.  I got the tuner sometime around May 2010.  When
ifconfig support is totally deprecated, it'll probably be time for a new
tuner anyways.

June 2010 is not "ancient".  Now I know what to avoid.

That's only 5 years old.  There is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't
support both static config and DHCP other than incompetence.

There are indications that it will pay attention to DHCP.  See, for

You could consider doing a tcpdump to see what the thing does when it
is turned on.  I don't know what you have as a dhcp server -- it is
handy if it can run tcpdump.  Still, enough of the protocol is
broadcast that you should be able to get a clue whether the HDHR is
DHCPing.

There are also indications that it doesn't want the stream to be
routed; it wants to be communicating only on the network segment
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HDHomeRun#Requirements>

A little bit confusing.

2010 isn't ancient.  The iproute2 was added to Linux perhaps 15 years
ago.  ifconfig has been emulated for a long long time.  So anything
you can do with ifconfig out to be possible with the ip command.

       ip was written by Alexey N. Kuznetsov and added in Linux 2.2.

As far as I know, "real" ifconfig is long gone.

The documentation of the ip command is so terrible that I still use
ifconfig.

I have a few of these.  Low-end versions.

I'm not sure that they are the optimal choice for your use.  It
depends on what things matter to you.

I might well be focusing more on price than you would.  For me, it is
part of the game.

- ones with real CPUs (i3 or better) are not that cheap

- I have old ones with older Atoms (Acer Revos).  Great for the time,
  but not now.

- I have a Zotac with an AMD E350.  Better than old Atoms, but
  limiting.

- I have Zotacs based on Celerons (847 and 1007).  Those have
  non-trivial crunch, but not main-stream crunch.  I run more-or-less
  current Fedora on them.

- they generally take notebook components (RAM, HDD / SSD) which seems
  OK but has its quirks.

- you can buy them bare-bones or populated.

In some ways, you might be better off buying a carefully select
notebook that you leave closed.  Perhaps cheaper for the same crunch.
The packaging isn't as nice.  Also: might take some hunting.

The Intel NUC is another to consider.  Also Gigabyte Brix.

Here's a random example of a Zotac Zbox bare-bones with a Haswell
(non-Atom) Celeron:
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856173102CVF&cm_re=zotac_zbox-_-56-173-102CVF-_-Product>
I'm not sure, but I think that Haswell is a win over even the pretty
good new generation of Atoms.
Note: I have not carefully selected this to be a good choice.

Here's a Bix based on a Celeron of the Atom family:
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856164017&cm_re=gigabyte_brix-_-56-164-017-_-Product>
It might be quieter than the Haswell-based Zotac.  Notice details like
that there is only one SODIMM slot.

If the stars align (actually if the holes align) sometimes you can mount 
the little box on the back of the monitor.  The key is "vesa" mounting 
holes.  Only some monitors have them.  Only some little boxes have 
brackets to fit on them.  I've only done that once.

  This particular model does not... period... end of story.  I've
already posted the results of "get help" for this device.  My model does
***NOT*** show...

/sys/ipaddr dhcp|"<ip> <mask> <gw> <dns>"

...as one of the supported commands.  Later models do.  I've done the
latest firmware upgrade, just in case.

  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXmi-6nVhCM which is the exact
same model I have.  I bought mine in 2010, but the reviewer notes that
it won some award at CES2008.  Consider it a 2008, possibly 2007, model.

  Kernel hasn't changed, but the Gentoo linux distribution has.  This is
a Gentoo-specific item.

  It waddles like a duck, quacks like a duck, flies like a duck; as far
as I'm concerned it is a duck.  Some people argue that current Intel X86
isn't really a CISC processor.  That it's actually a RISC processor that
emulates a CISC processor.  That's nitpicking.

I have an ASUS VivoPC-VM40B-01 (win8.0) now -02 (win8.1) :

     http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883220628

- runs Ubuntu 14.04 easily

I bought it originally to run the last two windows apps I need - personal
and corporate tax programs - turns out I can run new versions of these 
with wine 1.7

I would happily buy another if I needed another desktop box.

Now that the Raspberry Pi 2 is even capable of running Windows (and
promises to run Linux. XBMC etc even faster), I wonder if it might be
enough for your needs.

4xUSB
1xHDMI
1xMicroSD
1xRJ45 (for wired Ethernet)
1xMicroUSB (for power)

Wifi is usually offered by a USB dongle. Probably not much luck about a
second HDMI, tho. But can't beat the price.

The ASUS VivoPC-VM40B-01 suggested by Herb (actually, it's the -02 model)
is available from Canada Computers (my preferred source) for under $300. I
initially rejected it because the CC blurb does not mention any ports. But
the Asus website spec

http://www.asus.com/ca-en/ASUS_VivoPC/VivoPC_VM40B/specifications/

lists a whole slew of them:

Back I/O Ports
2 x USB 3.0
4 x USB 2.0
1 x HDMI
1 x VGA(D-Sub)-Out
1 x RJ45 LAN
1 x Kensington Lock
1 x DC-in
1 x Optical S/PDIF out
3 x Audio Jack(s) (Line in/Mic in/Speaker out)

Theoretically, one could run two monitors, using the VGA and HDMI ports,
although I'm not sure if the Intel graphics could handle that.

On the Raspberry Pi, it's an intriguing possibility, but a review mentions
that some applications are not available for the operating system
Raspbian.

The problem ended up being my router, once I updated the firmware
everything started working and I was able to setup ssh access with a RSA
key only.

The original Raspberry Pi was laughable as a desktop, but I just set up
a Raspberry Pi 2* yesterday, and it's not half bad. Browsing is pretty
snappy, and LibreOffice ? though by no means fast ? was usable. It
doesn't feel like a small machine. I'm definitely considering recycling
my old ThinkPad R51 (1.4 GHz Pentium-M, 1.5 GB RAM), as the Raspberry Pi
2 seems faster than it ever could be. No x86 compatibility, though, but
I don't really need it.

cheers,

| Strange... Cyanogenmod is Android app.

It's more like an Android distro.

I think that for a particular device, it is usually cobbled together
from bits of the official distro (because device drivers tend to be
closed source).  But I could be wrong: I've never run it.

The water is definitely muddied by Cyanogen Inc.  For example, on the
OnePlus CI produced the official (for now) Android port.

Interesting.  I think that he's half right about a lot of stuff.

Apple was NEVER a good guy with respect to freedom.  Except
accidentally.  For example, the computers after the Apple II were much
more locked down.

An underdog often looks like a Good Guy.  It would have little power
to impose its will on its customers.  It would have great incentive to
produce as much value in its product as it could so that it can
improve market share.  If the underdog ever becomes overdog, beware.

For me, Linux has been pretty usable on notebooks for quite some
time (20 years).  For Gilmor, the required tools were probably not
there initially, but perhaps more important was the impression of
inadequacy.  Barriers that might have mattered:

- careful picking of notebook to not get stuck with unsupported
  devices (gotten much better)

- residual configuration not done by vendor.  One good step was
  getting a reasonable defaulting in Xorg so that xorg.conf was
  generally not needed.

- Open Office getting "good enough".  Very subjective.  In fact
  it may well not be the best choice for ones actual task but
  it falls naturally to hand due to MS Office's mind share.

- games

- Adobe Flash (Apple has almost killed it!  Yay!)

- proprietary software (eg Tax software)

The big privacy battles are now internet-related.  Many are beyond our
reasonable control.  I can't imagine giving up internet search (I use
Duck Duck Go but I don't think that eliminates the problem).  The vast
majority of the internet is bought and paid for by privacy-destroying
marketing.

  This is what I get for TTFM (Trusting The Fine Manual). I did Google
and RTFM.  Page 6 of the PDF document at the manufacturer's website...
http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_tech.pdf lists the output
from a "get help" command ***FOR CURRENT MODELS***.  It includes,
amongst other items...

/sys/ipaddr dhcp|"<ip> <mask> <gw> <dns>"

  On my machine, "get help" produces...

Supported configuration options:
/ir/target <protocol>://<ip>:<port>
/lineup/location <countrycode>:<postcode>
/sys/copyright
/sys/debug
/sys/features
/sys/hwmodel
/sys/model
/sys/restart <resource>
/sys/version
/tuner<n>/channel <modulation>:<freq|ch>
/tuner<n>/channelmap <channelmap>
/tuner<n>/debug
/tuner<n>/filter "0x<nnnn>-0x<nnnn> [...]"
/tuner<n>/lockkey
/tuner<n>/program <program number>
/tuner<n>/streaminfo
/tuner<n>/status
/tuner<n>/target <ip>:<port>

  There is no mention of "/sys/ipaddr" ***ON MY MACHINE***.  I also
remember various people asking on the HDHomerun support forum years ago
about IP addresses, and hearing that this model did not have any other
addressing options.  One correction on the date of my machine.   See
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXmi-6nVhCM which discusses the exact
same model I have.  I bought mine in 2010, but the reviewer notes that
it won some award at CES2008.  Consider it a 2008 model.

  Due to the documentation, and lack of mention of DHCP in "get help",
I assumed it wouldn't work.  However, just for ####s and giggles, I
enabled the DHCP server on my router, set the DHCP address pool to
192.168.123.241-to-192.168.123.247, and expanded my local LAN subnet
from a /29 to a /28 like so...

config_eth0="
192.168.123.251/28 broadcast 192.168.123.255"
routes_eth0="
default via 192.168.123.254 metric 20
192.168.123.240/28 via 192.168.123.254 metric 0"

  Notice the lack of a 'modules=( "!iproute2" )' line.  I installed the
latest firmware update from the manufacturer's website...
(hdhomerun_atsc_firmware_20141124.bin).  Lo and behold, it actually
works, coming up at 192.168.123.241.  This is notwithstanding the
documentation and "get help" output, which both say nothing about DHCP.
Maybe this was a feature that was backported into a firmware update.
Anyhow, I apologize for wasting peoples' time.

Cyanogen Inc. is now a for-profit company with its own agenda, and I'm
leery of their claims that "it's all good and we're keeping everything
open source" - especially now that they're getting funding from
Microsoft.  I'm sure that RMS has consigned them to the bin for this
move - I'm a bit more open-minded than that, but seriously skeptical
about the turn of events.  I think your comparison is apt, but the
future is less than clear - and that's worth noting too.  See also the
OnePlus mess.

Well the firmware updates claim improved dhcp compatibility with new
routers as one of the things they have done.  Are you running the latest
firwmare on the box?

https://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/firmware-changelog/

Latest firwmare for the HDHR-US appears to be from 20141124:

Hey we learned something too.

I think the idea always was that it should use dhcp.  Newer models
started allowing static IP, but they all do dhcp.  dhcp is complicated
though and sometimes compatibility issues happen.  When dhcp does not
fail, it is very common to default to a link local address of 169.254.x.x,
which is certainly what windows does, and apparently also what the
HDHR does.

Here's the outcome of that project:

I purchased the Asus VIVOPC-VM40B-02 and a 22 inch Samsung LCD screen at
Canada Computers, total $557 (including HST). The computer comes with a
keyboard and mouse. (Thanks to Herb Richter for that suggestion.)

I was impressed by the packaging and build quality of the computer. I was
not impressed by Windows 8.1, which is a real dog's breakfast of Selling
Stuff and Requesting All Your Information, and a really badly designed UI.

So I downloaded the latest version of Linux Mint and installed that as a
dual-boot system. For those that haven't done this - first you use the
partition tool in Win8.1 to reduce the size of the windows partition,
freeing up space. Then, in the Linux install, you divide up that partition
and assign it. Fortunately I had gone through this process in a previous
install and I had good notes. I can't imagine the average user doing this.
Thank heaven for Google.

At the end of the installation we have a dual-boot selection menu that
comes up on power-on, and we can select either operating system. Both
operating systems detected and connected to the wireless network without
any fuss, which is convenient.

In the previous install process, on an Asus laptop, the grub boot menu is
somehow accessible only from inside Windows and there is a lengthy
song-and-dance needed to get to it. So this one is much more convenient.

Thanks to everyone who had suggestions for this project.

?David,

If she is having problems with ipad, it's most likely netbook would be appropriate either as she will have another unfamiliar interface.?

Get a refurbished mac from apple. They are good as new and no need spending a lot for a new one.

Apologies for top posting - I blame it on blackberry?

Regards,

William?

It sounds like she'll have problems with anything new, so I suspect
she'd be better off sticking with a Mac to reduce the learning curve.

the Win parition so you have to immediately boot into Windows (before
creating new partitions) and have it do a repair.  This is witchcraft.

(I think that Windows puts something immoveable in the middle of the
partition and linux just ignores that.)

1. If the network is not connected, then it will give you opportunity to
create "local" account.

2. When it asks for Microsoft id, type something common (ie.
user=abc at com, pass=abc) and it will complain, and give you "local"
account.

I'm sure it would be happy to tell everyone...

Memories of the '80s Faberge commercial, "You tell two friends, and
they tell two friends, and so on, and so on..."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcskckuosxQ

I can see how they'd do this thing of falling back to a less secure
mechanism, but it makes my
brain hurt that if authentication fails, they just degrade it and try
again without saying anything.
Very awful to depend on that, particularly if it was possible that you
were going to send that
intended-to-be-local authentication data to someone that shouldn't know it.

Nice dosage of "yechhhh!!!"

The Asus box seems nice enough; pretty similar, broadly, to my Zotac ID-88,
which I also bought at Canada Computers, albeit just long enough ago that
it seems to have gotten replaced by subsequent models.  My one challenge
in Linux installation was that my unit wasn't happy recognizing a Debian
boot CD.  I was able to use PXE booting instead, which worked out
perfectly fine.  I didn't get a Windows license with it, so had nothing to
preserve in that regard.

So will being persistent about going back/canceling.  It would sure be
nice if it wasn't so insistent.

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC44LA+dZpuX+wLF_C0GOSh1J573L8iDMXmvT0-ou929gg@mail.gmail.com>

I've started using git fairly heavily (although not necessarily very
well).  I have several repos: a couple are code, also my ~/.vim/
folder and I'm thinking about adding ~/bin/ .  If I remember to push
from a particular machine before leaving it, I'll never have to deal
with merging as I'm the only user.  While most likely my discomfort
with merging will be overcome by practice as I understand git does it
well (I use SVN at work: merging is shudder-inducing), I'm guessing
keeping everything up to date is still preferable.  These questions
are mostly about incorporating information about the repo into the
Bash prompt: I was impressed recently by the way zsh appears to handle
it, with a sequence of tiny icons in the lower right corner of the
terminal indicating relative status.  I didn't talk to the zsh user
long, so I don't know if that's built-in, a plugin, or something he
did himself.

I'm starting from some code I got from nitrous.io, lovely in its conciseness:

parse_git_branch () {
  git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e "s/*
\(.*\)/\1$(parse_git_dirty)/"
}
parse_git_dirty () {
  git diff --no-ext-diff --quiet --exit-code &>/dev/null || echo "!"
}

Put \$(parse_git_branch) into your prompt and it tells you what branch
you're on, and if there are any unstaged changes (and goes away if
you're not in a repo).  I'd prefer it did uncommitted rather than
unstaged, haven't tried to fix that yet.  But I want to update it as
it doesn't deal with origin at all.

So, the questions:

What is the easiest and most concise way to determine if your local is
behind origin master?  I've found that "git remote show origin" will
show this information, but I'm not sure if it's the "best" way to find
out, and I'm also concerned that running that every time your prompt
comes up would slow things down as it makes a remote call(?) to get an
answer - when you might not even have a network connection, or worse,
a very slow connection.

"git status" usually says "Your branch is up-to-date with
'origin/master'" (or "ahead"), but occasionally - even though origin
is configured properly - this line doesn't appear.  Is there a way to
convince it to always show this line?

Unfortunately, "git status" doesn't seem to ever notice if you're
"behind" origin, thus the need for "git remote show origin".  Any fix
for that?

The thought was to have output for the prompt that looked like this:

(everything synced): "master-"
(uncommitted local changes): "master!-"
(behind origin): "master^"
(ahead of origin): "masterv"
(ahead and behind, with local changes): "master!^v"

You get the general idea.

I'm aware git is capable of immense complexity (branches, detached
head, multiple remotes, different remotes for push and pull, etc.)
that aren't addressed here.  If I tried to tackle all of that at once
(especially given I don't understand most of it) my head would explode
and nothing would get done.  So I'm sticking with my simple use case
until I have to deal with the more complex stuff.

Any thoughts welcome.

Hi Giles,

Try installing 'gitk' graphical tool that visualize a lot of things your
asking about. Just run "gitk &" from anywhere under your git project root
repository.

Alex.

Hi Alex.

I live and die by the command line, and I'm fairly sure all of this
can be achieved without installing extra tools (and gitk wouldn't play
well with remote servers).  I'm hoping to have a quick status update
that's always there, no extra commands needed.

I'm a big fan of gitk -- the visual aspect of it appeals to me, as I can
see right away where I am, and where the remote branch is. As soon as you
do something on the command line, it's reflected in gitk.

I'm not a fan of cramming lots of stuff in the command line, but that's a
personal preference.

Alex

`git status` only looks at what's on your local file system.  You need
to first do a `git fetch` to update your local information (doesn't
change your code, just git's information), then `git status` will
reflect what's actually happening.  Without some command that fetches
things from the remote, `git status` will always say you're up-to-date
(or ahead if you've committed things).

Thanks, that's great.  I think bash-git-prompt will probably be the
answer, but the others look very helpful as well.

About the same time you were sending this, a co-worker was telling me
about the virtues of "git fetch" as opposed to "git pull" which I've
used almost exclusively.  It makes a lot more sense now, thanks.

To everyone who answered: I think we can consider my problems (at
least the git ones!) solved, and many thanks.

As far as finding out your status against a remote you will have to use a
network connection and query the remote. There's no way around that.
You can fetch the remote (git fetch) ahead of time, and I suppose get some
reasonable idea of where you stand later.

Try tig, a curses based git explorer http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/

What do you use for mail on the command line?

Ah, you're making a perfectly reasonable assumption that I can't live
up to.  I don't browse the web from the CLI and I don't do mail from
the CLI.  I'm trying to think of other exceptions - I'm sure there are
one or two - but I guess those are the major ones.

I used mutt for a year or so (a decade ago), but configuring it always
required a huge amount of reading, editing text files, cursing, and
rinse and repeat.  While vim is arguably the same, I found the rewards
greater - so I continue to use vim but these days I use Gmail's web
interface rather than mutt.

Seconding TIG, definitely my favourite git viewing tool, command line or

I do use mutt for my mail, and I do use elinks sometimes as well to
access things on the web.  Especially if I am downloading files.

alpine is a reasonable and reasonably simple "command line" mail user
agent.  Much simpler than mutt and much less powerful.

I've been using it for about 20 years.  There might well have been a
better choice that appeared during that time.

I run my own mail server at home (for more than 30 years) partly to
avoid giving control of my mail to third parties like Google.  I admit
that this is somewhat quixotic.

I actually did the opposite. I went from web to cli. Other than a few quirks
I'm pretty satisfied. A good addressbook is the only thing I haven't found, but
haven't really sought out either. I use mutt with esmtp, and getmail.

20 years ago I was triple-booting between Windows 95, OS/2, and Linux.
Not only was there a build of Pine (the predecessor of Alpine) for
each, but I got it to work with the same set of data files across all
three OSes.  I quite liked Pine, and used it for a number of years
after that.

I wonder if Alpine can be used with Gmail ...  There seem to be quite
a few answers to that on DuckDuckGo, I may need to do further
investigation!

I used nmh <http://www.nongnu.org/nmh/> for a decently long time;
got tugged into Gmail's orbit, but I still have a fair bit of toolset for
working with MH, and found it usually a rewarding way of accessing
email.

Google recently added archiving of mail as part of their "Takeout"
service (which is a Big Deal to me; it means that I can consider it
My Data that I can take away whenever I want to do so), and I
downloaded my mail as a giant Mbox file for the first time
yesterday.  I'm going to want to split it into smaller pieces and
archive it, ideally in a fashion that integrates somewhat with my
legacy MH mail.  It's no good to have it as one gigantic piece.
I'm musing things to do with it.  Ideas include:
a) Split into a message per file, just as with MH, and run a
    big batch job each time that stows them in some stable
    fashion (e.g. - so that when I pull the same messages
    NEXT month, they don't just get duplicated)
b) Split into messages, and use a DBMS-based mail storage
    system.  Musing on <http://archiveopteryx.org/>

A desirable result is to have the resulting mail stored in a
fashion that lends itself to running "git commit" against the
email repository.  a) might lead to too many files, but seems
otherwise largely desirable.  b) mightn't be all that nice to
"git commit", but is interesting in its own ways.

I tried out uzbl for cli-controlled web browsing; I wound
up struggling against it way too much.

One reason for moving from Pine to Mutt was threading of emails.
Does Alpine thread emails, now?

  I don't understand that.  Mutt's config is basically "set it an forget
it".  I have to add/delete entries whenever I subscribe/unsubscribe to
mailing lists, but that's it.  Years ago, I used to read email on a true
text console.  Then the linux devs screwed that possibility with video
drivers that take over the text console too.  On a 1920x1080 monitor,
even Sun 12x22 fonts are on the small side.

  I still use mutt in an xterm, along with mc.  I've even cobbled
together a cute script that allows me to launch HDHomerun TV from the
commandline.

   It always has. (At least since I started using it in 1995.)

I don't change anything in mutt for mailing lists.
What setting are you changing for mailing lists? aliases?
Any recommendations for a textmode addressbook?

  I add new aliases to ~/.mutt/.aliases as necessary.  I also have my
mail sorted into separate mailboxes by procmail.  Some of my boxes are...

mailboxes =dillo =eudev =gentoo =icewm =inbox =spam =teksavvy =tlug

  I pull email from 4 different sources with getmail, and have procmail
figure out which ~/Maildir subdirectory to drop it into.  It's a
many-to-many relationship.  I don't have a seprate "addressbook manager".
I simply use the ~/.mutt/.aliases file.

It's called 'captive portal'. Try dd-wrt, with a compatible wifi router.

I believe both pfsense and m0n0wall have "captive portal" support.

Both will run off a flash card, pfsense needs a little more hardware
(but not much) than m0n0wall does.

They run on certain embedded platforms, and generic intel boxes.

Hope that helps!

Subject: [GTALUG] war story: creating Raspberry Pi 2 boot card
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1503081215020.22232@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I found an excuse to buy a Raspberry Pi 2.  Mathematica was too slow on
the Raspberry Pi B.

We bought one at the Canada Robotix store in Markham.  $48.99 + 6.37 tax.

The RP2 uses Micro SD rather than normal SD and the software isn't
100% compatible so I created a new MicroSD as the "hard drive".

I used a SanDisk Extreme PLUS microSDHC UHS-1 32GB card (I had one on
hand).

I wanted to use the latest Raspbian because it is compatible with the
RP2 and includes Mathematica.

I tried several things before one worked.  I'm writing this up to save
others from frustration.  These accounts are based on my unreliable
memory -- I had no idea that it would have been worth taking notes.

I was kind of improvising, starting from here
<http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>

Spoiler: my current hypothesis is that my (Linux) desktop's SD
interface is silently busted in some way.

If you've done any of this, I'd like to hear how it worked for you.


Attempt 1:

- The card was brand new, already formatted with some FAT-family
  filesystem

- I fetched the NOOBS Offline and network install

- I installed the card in my desktop computer and used Linux unzip

- I moved the card to the RP2 and powered it on.
  The green "reading SD" and orange or red "power" LEDS came on and
  stayed on, with no other visible activity.  I gave up.


Attempt 2:

- same card

- from my desktop machine, I dd'ed the RASPBIAN image onto the card

- I tried to boot it.  Same result.


Attempt 3:

- same card

- booted Windows on a notebook and ran SD Formatter 4.0 (as prescribed
  in <http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/>) to create just
  the right filesystem.

- went to my desktop machine and unzipped NOOBS into the card

- I tried to boot it.  Same result.


Attempt 4:

- same card

- booted Windows on a notebook and ran SD Formatter 4.0 (as prescribed
  in <http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/>) to create just
  the right filesystem.

- I used Windows to unzipped NOOBS into the card

- I tried to boot it.  It worked!

================

Early hypotheses that are refuted:

- my microSD card was no good.  Or not compatible with the RP2

- my RP2 was no good


Lingering hypotheses:

- Perhaps my desktop's SD interface is silently busted.  It is a
  common factor on all failures.

- the preformatted filesystem that came on the microSD may not work
  for the RP2's boot system

- Linux's unzip botches things some way.  Perhaps some flag is needed.


Experiments I should try (but may not):

- retry each of the experiments that failed, but use Linux on my
  notebook rather than on my desktop.

- see if my notebook can read and verify microSD cards written by my
  desktop

When creating a system for the RP I have had a 100% success rate with
the GTK-based
Startup Disk Creator
<https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/usb-creator-gtk/> under Ubuntu.

'dd' has worked for me but I recall having to use some non-default block
settings. One article suggests "bs=1m" as an arg to dd.

I created an Ubuntu 14.04 boot image for the Pi 2 using (new to me)
*bmap-tools*. My notes for writing to microSD and setting up root to run
from an external USD hard drive:

Using bmap-tools makes sense if you are handed a .bmap file.
Apparently one was supplied in 2015-02-19-ubuntu-trusty.zip.

The file 2015-02-19-ubuntu-trusty.img contained in the .zip
originally had holes but these disappeared through the zipping.

Neither NOOBS_v1_4_0.zip nor 2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.zip contain a
.bmap file.  It would be good if they did, assuming that there were
significant holes.  Oh, and assuming that bytes corresponding to holes
need not be zeroed -- raw disks don't notionally have holes.

That's interesting.  I've avoided it since it does not treat the image
as a black-box and I haven't put the effort in to understand the
restrictions.  It does say on that page that it is for Debian-based
OSes (if I remember correctly, it failed when I tried it on Fedora; I
don't think that it warned me that it had failed).

I think that is only for speed.  The Raspberry Pi foundation
recommends bs=4M.  It's all superstion since it is going through the
buffer cache.

Most of the GUIs just add a different wodge of complexity, where each is 
subtly different.

 From the command-line, an alias or script like
git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color

will show you quite enough to make your head hurt, and is what the 
authoers use.

- Downloaded 2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.zip
- Unzip in /tmp
- Determined that the uSD was sdg on my workstation

# dd if=/tmp/2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdg

- Hook up Pi2 (HDMI, USB keyboard, USB power)
- Power up
- See quad raspberries on boot screen
- Enjoy

Since you're using NOOBS, YMMV.  I did note that the last two release log
entries for Raspbian spoke of Pi2 compatibility, so grab the latest of
whatever you're using and don't use an image you downloaded back when.

(If you do the latter, the Pi2 displays a pretty coloured block and just
sits there.  DAMHIKT.)

If you can't get to a Windows machine or Mac, low-level formatting on a
digital camera will clean up the card read for NOOBS. After that, I've
always had success with:

    unzip NOOBS-/ver/.zip -d /mountpoint_of_SD_card/


I think the SD card type sensitivity has gone away with more recent
firmwares on the Raspberry Pi, but they are still very critical of poor
power supplies. The 2 can be especially picky, since it can put out
larger currents over USB than the earlier models.

I do like the Model B Version 2. I'll have to see if it's faster than
the two older (> 5 years) computers I have lying about for dedicated jobs.

Incidentally, Lawrence now has a stock of the Raspberry Pi 2 now at
Creatron.

Good to know.  And for a dollar less than I paid.

Too bad that our meetings are no longer nearby (30 minute walk

I have a few Pi's and I have come to the conclusion that you can't skimp on
the SD cards.
Rasbian killed my el cheapo ADATA class 10 microSD.

OpenELEC and XMBC are unusable on the class 10 cards.

FreeBSD won't boot reliably with a class 10 or less SD card unless you use
the tweaks I mentioned here:
<http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=99151&sid=4784ce25811d943c46ce005dc8e89f12>

When I finally ponied up the cash for high speed Kingston Ultimate (90MB
read/40MB write) cards I had zero issues.

Missed this thread but thought I'd chime in with a plug for Oh My Zsh! I 
use it with a solarized terminal theme, the git plugin, and a customized 
prompt to show the git branch that I'm on:

export PROMPT="%{$FG[154]%}[%*|%D]% %{$fg[blue]%} 
%{%}%n%{%}@%{%}%m%{%}:%{$fg[red]%} %~% %{$fg[black]%}>>%k
  %{$FG[032]%} %B%? %s%%%k %b"

function git_prompt_info() {
     ref=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null) || return
     echo 
"$ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX${ref#refs/heads/}$ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX"
}

The nice thing about it is when something extends across the entirety of 
the prompt, the (branch-marker) goes away too.

I don't pretend to know what 99% of that does because once I got it 
setup I haven't ever dared fiddle with it :p

It doesn't do stuff like show revs ahead/behind or anything, but I'm 
sure some creative aliases would make that pretty straightforward.

Cheers, Jamon

It was pretty OK.  A bit pricier than the pizza joint; not something that
makes me lose sleep.

Service was decent (other Ethiopian places around town have tended
to be painfully slow!!!), we should have been a bit quicker about getting
ourselves rolling.  We were short on time by the end, which is to say
that dinner there properly needs about 1.5h, where what we had was
about 55 minutes.  That's not at all criticism of them; we were over
constrained.

The food was all good.  Spices were, I think, a bit restrained, which
was wise for enough of us.

Several people said they'd like to do it again with family and such.
I'd be keen on giving it 90 minutes to do it more justice!  :-)

Now, /that/'s an endorsement!

I don't know if Ethiopiques offer it, but leave time to have a coffee
ceremony at the end. It's rather fun, and quite apt for a group known
for turning caffeine into data structures. It's also a great way of
setting off smoke detectors, too ?

cheers,
 Stewart

Subject: [GTALUG] FSF Europe "Document Freedom Day"
Message-ID: <CAFNqd5XJi0-on5RG-UgR4VMuaPNYpFVAmRL1N_=N_8UWQtxUVQ@mail.gmail.com>

I just saw this yesterday afternoon, so there hasn't been opportunity
to do much vetting of this.

The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is doing a "Document
Freedom Day" to encourage awareness of Open Standards about document
formats.

  http://documentfreedom.org/

A primary sponsor is LibreOffice/The Document Foundation, which should
give some idea as to where the thoughts about standards might be
coming from.

The date of the event is March 25th, which is sufficiently close by
that I don't think we can organizationally get anything too major into
place, but if people are individually interested, see if there's
something you'd be keen on doing about it.

I'd think it a neat idea for us as individuals to forward this to our
various political representatives (e.g. - city councillors, MPPs, MPs)
to encourage their awareness as representatives of organizations that
manage rather a lot of documents on our behalf.  I would think that is
likely to be at nearly as effective as trying to do a formal
submission as an organization.
