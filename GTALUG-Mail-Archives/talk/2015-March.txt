  No.  I have an ancient HDHR-US model.  Looking back at my archived
emails, I figure that I got it sometime around June 2010.  The output
from "get help" is...

Supported configuration options:
/ir/target <protocol>://<ip>:<port>
/lineup/location <countrycode>:<postcode>
/sys/copyright
/sys/debug
/sys/features
/sys/hwmodel
/sys/model
/sys/restart <resource>
/sys/version
/tuner<n>/channel <modulation>:<freq|ch>
/tuner<n>/channelmap <channelmap>
/tuner<n>/debug

/tuner<n>/lockkey
/tuner<n>/program <program number>
/tuner<n>/streaminfo
/tuner<n>/status
/tuner<n>/target <ip>:<port>

  According to the manufacturer's site, the latest models support a lot
more stuff, including...

/sys/ipaddr dhcp|"<ip> <mask> <gw> <dns>"

... which allows to get/set ipaddress, or work as a dhcp client.

  Interesting.  I'll keep going with over-riding the iproute2 default
and force ifconfig, as the network-utility stack.  By the time ifconfig
support is deprecated in Gentoo, I'll probably be looking at getting a
new tuner, rather than another NIC.

  Thanks for the info anyways.  Now I can stop pounding my head against
the brick wall.

Why not go with the other option I mentioned, add another NIC.  They're
cheap and you can do what you want without violating the RFC.  All
you'll need to connect the tuner is a cross over Ethernet cable.  All
new hardware might set you back $10-$15

I'm considering the Zotac and Asus mini-pcs for the basis of a home-office
system. It won't be used for gaming, just spreadsheets, word processing
and internetting. I'm looking for a box with a bunch of usb ports, hdmi
port, wired network connection. Wi-fi and a second hdmi port would be a
bonus.

Has anyone installed Linux Mint on one of these types of machines?

Thanks -

  Even easier is to include the line...

modules=( "!iproute2" )

...in my /etc/conf.d/net (probably Gentoo specific) and it keeps working
using ifconfig.  I got the tuner sometime around May 2010.  When
ifconfig support is totally deprecated, it'll probably be time for a new
tuner anyways.

June 2010 is not "ancient".  Now I know what to avoid.

That's only 5 years old.  There is absolutely no reason why it shouldn't
support both static config and DHCP other than incompetence.

There are indications that it will pay attention to DHCP.  See, for

You could consider doing a tcpdump to see what the thing does when it
is turned on.  I don't know what you have as a dhcp server -- it is
handy if it can run tcpdump.  Still, enough of the protocol is
broadcast that you should be able to get a clue whether the HDHR is
DHCPing.

There are also indications that it doesn't want the stream to be
routed; it wants to be communicating only on the network segment
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HDHomeRun#Requirements>

A little bit confusing.

2010 isn't ancient.  The iproute2 was added to Linux perhaps 15 years
ago.  ifconfig has been emulated for a long long time.  So anything
you can do with ifconfig out to be possible with the ip command.

       ip was written by Alexey N. Kuznetsov and added in Linux 2.2.

As far as I know, "real" ifconfig is long gone.

The documentation of the ip command is so terrible that I still use
ifconfig.

I have a few of these.  Low-end versions.

I'm not sure that they are the optimal choice for your use.  It
depends on what things matter to you.

I might well be focusing more on price than you would.  For me, it is
part of the game.

- ones with real CPUs (i3 or better) are not that cheap

- I have old ones with older Atoms (Acer Revos).  Great for the time,
  but not now.

- I have a Zotac with an AMD E350.  Better than old Atoms, but
  limiting.

- I have Zotacs based on Celerons (847 and 1007).  Those have
  non-trivial crunch, but not main-stream crunch.  I run more-or-less
  current Fedora on them.

- they generally take notebook components (RAM, HDD / SSD) which seems
  OK but has its quirks.

- you can buy them bare-bones or populated.

In some ways, you might be better off buying a carefully select
notebook that you leave closed.  Perhaps cheaper for the same crunch.
The packaging isn't as nice.  Also: might take some hunting.

The Intel NUC is another to consider.  Also Gigabyte Brix.

Here's a random example of a Zotac Zbox bare-bones with a Haswell
(non-Atom) Celeron:
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856173102CVF&cm_re=zotac_zbox-_-56-173-102CVF-_-Product>
I'm not sure, but I think that Haswell is a win over even the pretty
good new generation of Atoms.
Note: I have not carefully selected this to be a good choice.

Here's a Bix based on a Celeron of the Atom family:
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856164017&cm_re=gigabyte_brix-_-56-164-017-_-Product>
It might be quieter than the Haswell-based Zotac.  Notice details like
that there is only one SODIMM slot.

If the stars align (actually if the holes align) sometimes you can mount 
the little box on the back of the monitor.  The key is "vesa" mounting 
holes.  Only some monitors have them.  Only some little boxes have 
brackets to fit on them.  I've only done that once.

  This particular model does not... period... end of story.  I've
already posted the results of "get help" for this device.  My model does
***NOT*** show...

/sys/ipaddr dhcp|"<ip> <mask> <gw> <dns>"

...as one of the supported commands.  Later models do.  I've done the
latest firmware upgrade, just in case.

  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXmi-6nVhCM which is the exact
same model I have.  I bought mine in 2010, but the reviewer notes that
it won some award at CES2008.  Consider it a 2008, possibly 2007, model.

  Kernel hasn't changed, but the Gentoo linux distribution has.  This is
a Gentoo-specific item.

  It waddles like a duck, quacks like a duck, flies like a duck; as far
as I'm concerned it is a duck.  Some people argue that current Intel X86
isn't really a CISC processor.  That it's actually a RISC processor that
emulates a CISC processor.  That's nitpicking.

I have an ASUS VivoPC-VM40B-01 (win8.0) now -02 (win8.1) :

     http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883220628

- runs Ubuntu 14.04 easily

I bought it originally to run the last two windows apps I need - personal
and corporate tax programs - turns out I can run new versions of these 
with wine 1.7

I would happily buy another if I needed another desktop box.

Now that the Raspberry Pi 2 is even capable of running Windows (and
promises to run Linux. XBMC etc even faster), I wonder if it might be
enough for your needs.

4xUSB
1xHDMI
1xMicroSD
1xRJ45 (for wired Ethernet)
1xMicroUSB (for power)

Wifi is usually offered by a USB dongle. Probably not much luck about a
second HDMI, tho. But can't beat the price.

The ASUS VivoPC-VM40B-01 suggested by Herb (actually, it's the -02 model)
is available from Canada Computers (my preferred source) for under $300. I
initially rejected it because the CC blurb does not mention any ports. But
the Asus website spec

http://www.asus.com/ca-en/ASUS_VivoPC/VivoPC_VM40B/specifications/

lists a whole slew of them:

Back I/O Ports
2 x USB 3.0
4 x USB 2.0
1 x HDMI
1 x VGA(D-Sub)-Out
1 x RJ45 LAN
1 x Kensington Lock
1 x DC-in
1 x Optical S/PDIF out
3 x Audio Jack(s) (Line in/Mic in/Speaker out)

Theoretically, one could run two monitors, using the VGA and HDMI ports,
although I'm not sure if the Intel graphics could handle that.

On the Raspberry Pi, it's an intriguing possibility, but a review mentions
that some applications are not available for the operating system
Raspbian.

The problem ended up being my router, once I updated the firmware
everything started working and I was able to setup ssh access with a RSA
key only.

The original Raspberry Pi was laughable as a desktop, but I just set up
a Raspberry Pi 2* yesterday, and it's not half bad. Browsing is pretty
snappy, and LibreOffice ? though by no means fast ? was usable. It
doesn't feel like a small machine. I'm definitely considering recycling
my old ThinkPad R51 (1.4 GHz Pentium-M, 1.5 GB RAM), as the Raspberry Pi
2 seems faster than it ever could be. No x86 compatibility, though, but
I don't really need it.

cheers,

| Strange... Cyanogenmod is Android app.

It's more like an Android distro.

I think that for a particular device, it is usually cobbled together
from bits of the official distro (because device drivers tend to be
closed source).  But I could be wrong: I've never run it.

The water is definitely muddied by Cyanogen Inc.  For example, on the
OnePlus CI produced the official (for now) Android port.

Interesting.  I think that he's half right about a lot of stuff.

Apple was NEVER a good guy with respect to freedom.  Except
accidentally.  For example, the computers after the Apple II were much
more locked down.

An underdog often looks like a Good Guy.  It would have little power
to impose its will on its customers.  It would have great incentive to
produce as much value in its product as it could so that it can
improve market share.  If the underdog ever becomes overdog, beware.

For me, Linux has been pretty usable on notebooks for quite some
time (20 years).  For Gilmor, the required tools were probably not
there initially, but perhaps more important was the impression of
inadequacy.  Barriers that might have mattered:

- careful picking of notebook to not get stuck with unsupported
  devices (gotten much better)

- residual configuration not done by vendor.  One good step was
  getting a reasonable defaulting in Xorg so that xorg.conf was
  generally not needed.

- Open Office getting "good enough".  Very subjective.  In fact
  it may well not be the best choice for ones actual task but
  it falls naturally to hand due to MS Office's mind share.

- games

- Adobe Flash (Apple has almost killed it!  Yay!)

- proprietary software (eg Tax software)

The big privacy battles are now internet-related.  Many are beyond our
reasonable control.  I can't imagine giving up internet search (I use
Duck Duck Go but I don't think that eliminates the problem).  The vast
majority of the internet is bought and paid for by privacy-destroying
marketing.

  This is what I get for TTFM (Trusting The Fine Manual). I did Google
and RTFM.  Page 6 of the PDF document at the manufacturer's website...
http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_tech.pdf lists the output
from a "get help" command ***FOR CURRENT MODELS***.  It includes,
amongst other items...

/sys/ipaddr dhcp|"<ip> <mask> <gw> <dns>"

  On my machine, "get help" produces...

Supported configuration options:
/ir/target <protocol>://<ip>:<port>
/lineup/location <countrycode>:<postcode>
/sys/copyright
/sys/debug
/sys/features
/sys/hwmodel
/sys/model
/sys/restart <resource>
/sys/version
/tuner<n>/channel <modulation>:<freq|ch>
/tuner<n>/channelmap <channelmap>
/tuner<n>/debug
/tuner<n>/filter "0x<nnnn>-0x<nnnn> [...]"
/tuner<n>/lockkey
/tuner<n>/program <program number>
/tuner<n>/streaminfo
/tuner<n>/status
/tuner<n>/target <ip>:<port>

  There is no mention of "/sys/ipaddr" ***ON MY MACHINE***.  I also
remember various people asking on the HDHomerun support forum years ago
about IP addresses, and hearing that this model did not have any other
addressing options.  One correction on the date of my machine.   See
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXmi-6nVhCM which discusses the exact
same model I have.  I bought mine in 2010, but the reviewer notes that
it won some award at CES2008.  Consider it a 2008 model.

  Due to the documentation, and lack of mention of DHCP in "get help",
I assumed it wouldn't work.  However, just for ####s and giggles, I
enabled the DHCP server on my router, set the DHCP address pool to
192.168.123.241-to-192.168.123.247, and expanded my local LAN subnet
from a /29 to a /28 like so...

config_eth0="
192.168.123.251/28 broadcast 192.168.123.255"
routes_eth0="
default via 192.168.123.254 metric 20
192.168.123.240/28 via 192.168.123.254 metric 0"

  Notice the lack of a 'modules=( "!iproute2" )' line.  I installed the
latest firmware update from the manufacturer's website...
(hdhomerun_atsc_firmware_20141124.bin).  Lo and behold, it actually
works, coming up at 192.168.123.241.  This is notwithstanding the
documentation and "get help" output, which both say nothing about DHCP.
Maybe this was a feature that was backported into a firmware update.
Anyhow, I apologize for wasting peoples' time.

Cyanogen Inc. is now a for-profit company with its own agenda, and I'm
leery of their claims that "it's all good and we're keeping everything
open source" - especially now that they're getting funding from
Microsoft.  I'm sure that RMS has consigned them to the bin for this
move - I'm a bit more open-minded than that, but seriously skeptical
about the turn of events.  I think your comparison is apt, but the
future is less than clear - and that's worth noting too.  See also the
OnePlus mess.

Well the firmware updates claim improved dhcp compatibility with new
routers as one of the things they have done.  Are you running the latest
firwmare on the box?

https://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/firmware-changelog/

Latest firwmare for the HDHR-US appears to be from 20141124:

Hey we learned something too.

I think the idea always was that it should use dhcp.  Newer models
started allowing static IP, but they all do dhcp.  dhcp is complicated
though and sometimes compatibility issues happen.  When dhcp does not
fail, it is very common to default to a link local address of 169.254.x.x,
which is certainly what windows does, and apparently also what the
HDHR does.

Here's the outcome of that project:

I purchased the Asus VIVOPC-VM40B-02 and a 22 inch Samsung LCD screen at
Canada Computers, total $557 (including HST). The computer comes with a
keyboard and mouse. (Thanks to Herb Richter for that suggestion.)

I was impressed by the packaging and build quality of the computer. I was
not impressed by Windows 8.1, which is a real dog's breakfast of Selling
Stuff and Requesting All Your Information, and a really badly designed UI.

So I downloaded the latest version of Linux Mint and installed that as a
dual-boot system. For those that haven't done this - first you use the
partition tool in Win8.1 to reduce the size of the windows partition,
freeing up space. Then, in the Linux install, you divide up that partition
and assign it. Fortunately I had gone through this process in a previous
install and I had good notes. I can't imagine the average user doing this.
Thank heaven for Google.

At the end of the installation we have a dual-boot selection menu that
comes up on power-on, and we can select either operating system. Both
operating systems detected and connected to the wireless network without
any fuss, which is convenient.

In the previous install process, on an Asus laptop, the grub boot menu is
somehow accessible only from inside Windows and there is a lengthy
song-and-dance needed to get to it. So this one is much more convenient.

Thanks to everyone who had suggestions for this project.

?David,

If she is having problems with ipad, it's most likely netbook would be appropriate either as she will have another unfamiliar interface.?

Get a refurbished mac from apple. They are good as new and no need spending a lot for a new one.

Apologies for top posting - I blame it on blackberry?

Regards,

William?

It sounds like she'll have problems with anything new, so I suspect
she'd be better off sticking with a Mac to reduce the learning curve.

the Win parition so you have to immediately boot into Windows (before
creating new partitions) and have it do a repair.  This is witchcraft.

(I think that Windows puts something immoveable in the middle of the
partition and linux just ignores that.)

1. If the network is not connected, then it will give you opportunity to
create "local" account.

2. When it asks for Microsoft id, type something common (ie.
user=abc at com, pass=abc) and it will complain, and give you "local"
account.

I'm sure it would be happy to tell everyone...

Memories of the '80s Faberge commercial, "You tell two friends, and
they tell two friends, and so on, and so on..."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcskckuosxQ

I can see how they'd do this thing of falling back to a less secure
mechanism, but it makes my
brain hurt that if authentication fails, they just degrade it and try
again without saying anything.
Very awful to depend on that, particularly if it was possible that you
were going to send that
intended-to-be-local authentication data to someone that shouldn't know it.

Nice dosage of "yechhhh!!!"

The Asus box seems nice enough; pretty similar, broadly, to my Zotac ID-88,
which I also bought at Canada Computers, albeit just long enough ago that
it seems to have gotten replaced by subsequent models.  My one challenge
in Linux installation was that my unit wasn't happy recognizing a Debian
boot CD.  I was able to use PXE booting instead, which worked out
perfectly fine.  I didn't get a Windows license with it, so had nothing to
preserve in that regard.

So will being persistent about going back/canceling.  It would sure be
nice if it wasn't so insistent.

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC44LA+dZpuX+wLF_C0GOSh1J573L8iDMXmvT0-ou929gg@mail.gmail.com>

I've started using git fairly heavily (although not necessarily very
well).  I have several repos: a couple are code, also my ~/.vim/
folder and I'm thinking about adding ~/bin/ .  If I remember to push
from a particular machine before leaving it, I'll never have to deal
with merging as I'm the only user.  While most likely my discomfort
with merging will be overcome by practice as I understand git does it
well (I use SVN at work: merging is shudder-inducing), I'm guessing
keeping everything up to date is still preferable.  These questions
are mostly about incorporating information about the repo into the
Bash prompt: I was impressed recently by the way zsh appears to handle
it, with a sequence of tiny icons in the lower right corner of the
terminal indicating relative status.  I didn't talk to the zsh user
long, so I don't know if that's built-in, a plugin, or something he
did himself.

I'm starting from some code I got from nitrous.io, lovely in its conciseness:

parse_git_branch () {
  git branch --no-color 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e "s/*
\(.*\)/\1$(parse_git_dirty)/"
}
parse_git_dirty () {
  git diff --no-ext-diff --quiet --exit-code &>/dev/null || echo "!"
}

Put \$(parse_git_branch) into your prompt and it tells you what branch
you're on, and if there are any unstaged changes (and goes away if
you're not in a repo).  I'd prefer it did uncommitted rather than
unstaged, haven't tried to fix that yet.  But I want to update it as
it doesn't deal with origin at all.

So, the questions:

What is the easiest and most concise way to determine if your local is
behind origin master?  I've found that "git remote show origin" will
show this information, but I'm not sure if it's the "best" way to find
out, and I'm also concerned that running that every time your prompt
comes up would slow things down as it makes a remote call(?) to get an
answer - when you might not even have a network connection, or worse,
a very slow connection.

"git status" usually says "Your branch is up-to-date with
'origin/master'" (or "ahead"), but occasionally - even though origin
is configured properly - this line doesn't appear.  Is there a way to
convince it to always show this line?

Unfortunately, "git status" doesn't seem to ever notice if you're
"behind" origin, thus the need for "git remote show origin".  Any fix
for that?

The thought was to have output for the prompt that looked like this:

(everything synced): "master-"
(uncommitted local changes): "master!-"
(behind origin): "master^"
(ahead of origin): "masterv"
(ahead and behind, with local changes): "master!^v"

You get the general idea.

I'm aware git is capable of immense complexity (branches, detached
head, multiple remotes, different remotes for push and pull, etc.)
that aren't addressed here.  If I tried to tackle all of that at once
(especially given I don't understand most of it) my head would explode
and nothing would get done.  So I'm sticking with my simple use case
until I have to deal with the more complex stuff.

Any thoughts welcome.

Hi Giles,

Try installing 'gitk' graphical tool that visualize a lot of things your
asking about. Just run "gitk &" from anywhere under your git project root
repository.

Alex.

Hi Alex.

I live and die by the command line, and I'm fairly sure all of this
can be achieved without installing extra tools (and gitk wouldn't play
well with remote servers).  I'm hoping to have a quick status update
that's always there, no extra commands needed.

I'm a big fan of gitk -- the visual aspect of it appeals to me, as I can
see right away where I am, and where the remote branch is. As soon as you
do something on the command line, it's reflected in gitk.

I'm not a fan of cramming lots of stuff in the command line, but that's a
personal preference.

Alex

`git status` only looks at what's on your local file system.  You need
to first do a `git fetch` to update your local information (doesn't
change your code, just git's information), then `git status` will
reflect what's actually happening.  Without some command that fetches
things from the remote, `git status` will always say you're up-to-date
(or ahead if you've committed things).

Thanks, that's great.  I think bash-git-prompt will probably be the
answer, but the others look very helpful as well.

About the same time you were sending this, a co-worker was telling me
about the virtues of "git fetch" as opposed to "git pull" which I've
used almost exclusively.  It makes a lot more sense now, thanks.

To everyone who answered: I think we can consider my problems (at
least the git ones!) solved, and many thanks.

As far as finding out your status against a remote you will have to use a
network connection and query the remote. There's no way around that.
You can fetch the remote (git fetch) ahead of time, and I suppose get some
reasonable idea of where you stand later.

Try tig, a curses based git explorer http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/

What do you use for mail on the command line?

Ah, you're making a perfectly reasonable assumption that I can't live
up to.  I don't browse the web from the CLI and I don't do mail from
the CLI.  I'm trying to think of other exceptions - I'm sure there are
one or two - but I guess those are the major ones.

I used mutt for a year or so (a decade ago), but configuring it always
required a huge amount of reading, editing text files, cursing, and
rinse and repeat.  While vim is arguably the same, I found the rewards
greater - so I continue to use vim but these days I use Gmail's web
interface rather than mutt.

Seconding TIG, definitely my favourite git viewing tool, command line or

I do use mutt for my mail, and I do use elinks sometimes as well to
access things on the web.  Especially if I am downloading files.

alpine is a reasonable and reasonably simple "command line" mail user
agent.  Much simpler than mutt and much less powerful.

I've been using it for about 20 years.  There might well have been a
better choice that appeared during that time.

I run my own mail server at home (for more than 30 years) partly to
avoid giving control of my mail to third parties like Google.  I admit
that this is somewhat quixotic.

I actually did the opposite. I went from web to cli. Other than a few quirks
I'm pretty satisfied. A good addressbook is the only thing I haven't found, but
haven't really sought out either. I use mutt with esmtp, and getmail.

20 years ago I was triple-booting between Windows 95, OS/2, and Linux.
Not only was there a build of Pine (the predecessor of Alpine) for
each, but I got it to work with the same set of data files across all
three OSes.  I quite liked Pine, and used it for a number of years
after that.

I wonder if Alpine can be used with Gmail ...  There seem to be quite
a few answers to that on DuckDuckGo, I may need to do further
investigation!

I used nmh <http://www.nongnu.org/nmh/> for a decently long time;
got tugged into Gmail's orbit, but I still have a fair bit of toolset for
working with MH, and found it usually a rewarding way of accessing
email.

Google recently added archiving of mail as part of their "Takeout"
service (which is a Big Deal to me; it means that I can consider it
My Data that I can take away whenever I want to do so), and I
downloaded my mail as a giant Mbox file for the first time
yesterday.  I'm going to want to split it into smaller pieces and
archive it, ideally in a fashion that integrates somewhat with my
legacy MH mail.  It's no good to have it as one gigantic piece.
I'm musing things to do with it.  Ideas include:
a) Split into a message per file, just as with MH, and run a
    big batch job each time that stows them in some stable
    fashion (e.g. - so that when I pull the same messages
    NEXT month, they don't just get duplicated)
b) Split into messages, and use a DBMS-based mail storage
    system.  Musing on <http://archiveopteryx.org/>

A desirable result is to have the resulting mail stored in a
fashion that lends itself to running "git commit" against the
email repository.  a) might lead to too many files, but seems
otherwise largely desirable.  b) mightn't be all that nice to
"git commit", but is interesting in its own ways.

I tried out uzbl for cli-controlled web browsing; I wound
up struggling against it way too much.

One reason for moving from Pine to Mutt was threading of emails.
Does Alpine thread emails, now?

  I don't understand that.  Mutt's config is basically "set it an forget
it".  I have to add/delete entries whenever I subscribe/unsubscribe to
mailing lists, but that's it.  Years ago, I used to read email on a true
text console.  Then the linux devs screwed that possibility with video
drivers that take over the text console too.  On a 1920x1080 monitor,
even Sun 12x22 fonts are on the small side.

  I still use mutt in an xterm, along with mc.  I've even cobbled
together a cute script that allows me to launch HDHomerun TV from the
commandline.

   It always has. (At least since I started using it in 1995.)

I don't change anything in mutt for mailing lists.
What setting are you changing for mailing lists? aliases?
Any recommendations for a textmode addressbook?

  I add new aliases to ~/.mutt/.aliases as necessary.  I also have my
mail sorted into separate mailboxes by procmail.  Some of my boxes are...

mailboxes =dillo =eudev =gentoo =icewm =inbox =spam =teksavvy =tlug

  I pull email from 4 different sources with getmail, and have procmail
figure out which ~/Maildir subdirectory to drop it into.  It's a
many-to-many relationship.  I don't have a seprate "addressbook manager".
I simply use the ~/.mutt/.aliases file.

It's called 'captive portal'. Try dd-wrt, with a compatible wifi router.

I believe both pfsense and m0n0wall have "captive portal" support.

Both will run off a flash card, pfsense needs a little more hardware
(but not much) than m0n0wall does.

They run on certain embedded platforms, and generic intel boxes.

Hope that helps!

Subject: [GTALUG] war story: creating Raspberry Pi 2 boot card
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1503081215020.22232@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I found an excuse to buy a Raspberry Pi 2.  Mathematica was too slow on
the Raspberry Pi B.

We bought one at the Canada Robotix store in Markham.  $48.99 + 6.37 tax.

The RP2 uses Micro SD rather than normal SD and the software isn't
100% compatible so I created a new MicroSD as the "hard drive".

I used a SanDisk Extreme PLUS microSDHC UHS-1 32GB card (I had one on
hand).

I wanted to use the latest Raspbian because it is compatible with the
RP2 and includes Mathematica.

I tried several things before one worked.  I'm writing this up to save
others from frustration.  These accounts are based on my unreliable
memory -- I had no idea that it would have been worth taking notes.

I was kind of improvising, starting from here
<http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>

Spoiler: my current hypothesis is that my (Linux) desktop's SD
interface is silently busted in some way.

If you've done any of this, I'd like to hear how it worked for you.


Attempt 1:

- The card was brand new, already formatted with some FAT-family
  filesystem

- I fetched the NOOBS Offline and network install

- I installed the card in my desktop computer and used Linux unzip

- I moved the card to the RP2 and powered it on.
  The green "reading SD" and orange or red "power" LEDS came on and
  stayed on, with no other visible activity.  I gave up.


Attempt 2:

- same card

- from my desktop machine, I dd'ed the RASPBIAN image onto the card

- I tried to boot it.  Same result.


Attempt 3:

- same card

- booted Windows on a notebook and ran SD Formatter 4.0 (as prescribed
  in <http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/>) to create just
  the right filesystem.

- went to my desktop machine and unzipped NOOBS into the card

- I tried to boot it.  Same result.


Attempt 4:

- same card

- booted Windows on a notebook and ran SD Formatter 4.0 (as prescribed
  in <http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/>) to create just
  the right filesystem.

- I used Windows to unzipped NOOBS into the card

- I tried to boot it.  It worked!

================

Early hypotheses that are refuted:

- my microSD card was no good.  Or not compatible with the RP2

- my RP2 was no good


Lingering hypotheses:

- Perhaps my desktop's SD interface is silently busted.  It is a
  common factor on all failures.

- the preformatted filesystem that came on the microSD may not work
  for the RP2's boot system

- Linux's unzip botches things some way.  Perhaps some flag is needed.


Experiments I should try (but may not):

- retry each of the experiments that failed, but use Linux on my
  notebook rather than on my desktop.

- see if my notebook can read and verify microSD cards written by my
  desktop

When creating a system for the RP I have had a 100% success rate with
the GTK-based
Startup Disk Creator
<https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/usb-creator-gtk/> under Ubuntu.

'dd' has worked for me but I recall having to use some non-default block
settings. One article suggests "bs=1m" as an arg to dd.

I created an Ubuntu 14.04 boot image for the Pi 2 using (new to me)
*bmap-tools*. My notes for writing to microSD and setting up root to run
from an external USD hard drive:

Using bmap-tools makes sense if you are handed a .bmap file.
Apparently one was supplied in 2015-02-19-ubuntu-trusty.zip.

The file 2015-02-19-ubuntu-trusty.img contained in the .zip
originally had holes but these disappeared through the zipping.

Neither NOOBS_v1_4_0.zip nor 2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.zip contain a
.bmap file.  It would be good if they did, assuming that there were
significant holes.  Oh, and assuming that bytes corresponding to holes
need not be zeroed -- raw disks don't notionally have holes.

That's interesting.  I've avoided it since it does not treat the image
as a black-box and I haven't put the effort in to understand the
restrictions.  It does say on that page that it is for Debian-based
OSes (if I remember correctly, it failed when I tried it on Fedora; I
don't think that it warned me that it had failed).

I think that is only for speed.  The Raspberry Pi foundation
recommends bs=4M.  It's all superstion since it is going through the
buffer cache.

Most of the GUIs just add a different wodge of complexity, where each is 
subtly different.

 From the command-line, an alias or script like
git log --oneline --abbrev-commit --all --graph --decorate --color

will show you quite enough to make your head hurt, and is what the 
authoers use.

- Downloaded 2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.zip
- Unzip in /tmp
- Determined that the uSD was sdg on my workstation

# dd if=/tmp/2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdg

- Hook up Pi2 (HDMI, USB keyboard, USB power)
- Power up
- See quad raspberries on boot screen
- Enjoy

Since you're using NOOBS, YMMV.  I did note that the last two release log
entries for Raspbian spoke of Pi2 compatibility, so grab the latest of
whatever you're using and don't use an image you downloaded back when.

(If you do the latter, the Pi2 displays a pretty coloured block and just
sits there.  DAMHIKT.)

If you can't get to a Windows machine or Mac, low-level formatting on a
digital camera will clean up the card read for NOOBS. After that, I've
always had success with:

    unzip NOOBS-/ver/.zip -d /mountpoint_of_SD_card/


I think the SD card type sensitivity has gone away with more recent
firmwares on the Raspberry Pi, but they are still very critical of poor
power supplies. The 2 can be especially picky, since it can put out
larger currents over USB than the earlier models.

I do like the Model B Version 2. I'll have to see if it's faster than
the two older (> 5 years) computers I have lying about for dedicated jobs.

Incidentally, Lawrence now has a stock of the Raspberry Pi 2 now at
Creatron.

I have a few Pi's and I have come to the conclusion that you can't skimp on
the SD cards.
Rasbian killed my el cheapo ADATA class 10 microSD.

OpenELEC and XMBC are unusable on the class 10 cards.

FreeBSD won't boot reliably with a class 10 or less SD card unless you use
the tweaks I mentioned here:
<http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=99151&sid=4784ce25811d943c46ce005dc8e89f12>

When I finally ponied up the cash for high speed Kingston Ultimate (90MB
read/40MB write) cards I had zero issues.

Missed this thread but thought I'd chime in with a plug for Oh My Zsh! I 
use it with a solarized terminal theme, the git plugin, and a customized 
prompt to show the git branch that I'm on:

export PROMPT="%{$FG[154]%}[%*|%D]% %{$fg[blue]%} 
%{%}%n%{%}@%{%}%m%{%}:%{$fg[red]%} %~% %{$fg[black]%}>>%k
  %{$FG[032]%} %B%? %s%%%k %b"

function git_prompt_info() {
     ref=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null) || return
     echo 
"$ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX${ref#refs/heads/}$ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX"
}

The nice thing about it is when something extends across the entirety of 
the prompt, the (branch-marker) goes away too.

I don't pretend to know what 99% of that does because once I got it 
setup I haven't ever dared fiddle with it :p

It doesn't do stuff like show revs ahead/behind or anything, but I'm 
sure some creative aliases would make that pretty straightforward.

Cheers, Jamon

It was pretty OK.  A bit pricier than the pizza joint; not something that
makes me lose sleep.

Service was decent (other Ethiopian places around town have tended
to be painfully slow!!!), we should have been a bit quicker about getting
ourselves rolling.  We were short on time by the end, which is to say
that dinner there properly needs about 1.5h, where what we had was
about 55 minutes.  That's not at all criticism of them; we were over
constrained.

The food was all good.  Spices were, I think, a bit restrained, which
was wise for enough of us.

Several people said they'd like to do it again with family and such.
I'd be keen on giving it 90 minutes to do it more justice!  :-)

I don't know if Ethiopiques offer it, but leave time to have a coffee
ceremony at the end. It's rather fun, and quite apt for a group known
for turning caffeine into data structures. It's also a great way of
setting off smoke detectors, too ?

Message-ID: <CAFNqd5XJi0-on5RG-UgR4VMuaPNYpFVAmRL1N_=N_8UWQtxUVQ@mail.gmail.com>

I just saw this yesterday afternoon, so there hasn't been opportunity
to do much vetting of this.

The Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) is doing a "Document
Freedom Day" to encourage awareness of Open Standards about document
formats.

  http://documentfreedom.org/

A primary sponsor is LibreOffice/The Document Foundation, which should
give some idea as to where the thoughts about standards might be
coming from.

The date of the event is March 25th, which is sufficiently close by
that I don't think we can organizationally get anything too major into
place, but if people are individually interested, see if there's
something you'd be keen on doing about it.

I'd think it a neat idea for us as individuals to forward this to our
various political representatives (e.g. - city councillors, MPPs, MPs)
to encourage their awareness as representatives of organizations that
manage rather a lot of documents on our behalf.  I would think that is
likely to be at nearly as effective as trying to do a formal
submission as an organization.

Message-ID: <CAPik5MzO4NR-vp0kdX=8457noq-BxsTUnnwnn_4OffbrzP=xmw@mail.gmail.com>

I live close to the exhibition grounds which is near to one of the city's
major grid switches. For example, they were testing the new streetcars, the
ones with three sections for navigating tight turns and they browned us
down to (I assume) 50hz. This was visible as all the lights dimmed and the
streetcar appeared to navigate the loop a short time later. As I don't have
ups I had powered down my tower. The next time I powered up the breaker in
the power supply tripped and when I reset it and booted, my 1.5v agp video
card was toasted, at least I hope its the card and not elsewhere on the bus.

So that's not so bad, there's no enterprise stuff at risk, I just hack
together another box and carry on. However, now I have a real problem and
I'm in need of a solution. Yesterday I fired up the WiFi while my SO was
drying her hair. I toasted her salon quality hair dryer. Not good. :-(
There is no gfi outlet and at this point I'm wondering if I need UPS, for
the hair dryer, if not the computer.

So my question is, does anyone on this list have similar problems and a low
cost hack they have used to deal with Toronto's iffy grid.

Something seems wrong here.  If that's actually happening, there's a
problem with the power distribution network and you'd need a TTC power
station nearby.  Streetcars run on DC, not AC and those stations are
used to convert 60 Hz (not 50) to DC.  I suspect that power dip was
caused by something else.  If it was caused by streetcars, you'd see it
happening frequently.  A UPS is always a good idea, but I really doubt
your WiFi damaged the dryer.  A GFI outlet protects people against
electrical leakage.  It does not protect equipment.  However, it's a
good idea to have one for safety with outlets nears sinks etc.

Changing the frequency of the power grid is VERY hard.  Dropping the
voltage (which is a brownout) is easy.

So no way did yo udrop to 50 Hz.  A few years ago a mejor mess in europe
caused the grid there to split into 3 parts, running at 48, 50 and 52Hz
respectively, due to severe imbalance in the network, and the frequencies
could only be different because the grid completely split.  So to drop
the frequency to 50Hz in Toronto would require changing the frequency
of a very large part of the grid in north america.  Not going to happen.

Unless your area has serious transformer issues, you should not have

Yeah, I agree. Frequency isn't likely to change. It depends on the rate of
rotation of massive generators in the Adam Beck generating station, for
one thing. And the whole system is locked together, as Lennart points out.

If you have access to the fuse or circuit box, I'd recommend measuring the
voltage at that point, then at the hair dryer outlet. There might be a
marginal connection somewhere that is dropping the voltage. Don't open up
the distribution box unless you are an electrician, electrical engineer or
immortal. There are lethal voltages and currents inside.

War story: Years ago I worked one summer as the effects guy at the Red
Barn Theatre in Jackson's Point. We had a three phase lighting board and
the power coming into the barn was two phase. So I checked with my power
engineering colleague and he confirmed it was OK to put two phases of the
lighting board on one side of the power and one phase on the other side,
and then to be a bit careful about the loading.

This worked well all through the rehearsal period. Then, at the opening
night reception, where everyone is in formal wear and eating tiny pieces
of fish, all of sudden every light in the place goes out. Of course,
everyone looks at me. So I go down to the distribution box with my
voltmeter, trailed by about 10 people, and measure the power at the entry
point, before the master switch and fuses. No input power. So I say 'Not
our problem, the Hydro is down.' Of course, nobody believes me and there
is some mutinous muttering. So I go down to the road to see if I can see
anything and in the distance, I can see flashing red lights. Turns out
some drunk had taken out a hydro pole. Fortunately, the Hydro guys had it
back up and running in a matter of minutes.

That was a nervous few minutes...

A single AAA cell can potentially provide lethal currents. It's the
high voltage in the box that allows a lethal amount of current to flow
through the relatively high resistance of your skin.

Explain that to me. How can an AAA cell provide lethal current?

Use two metal needles to pierce your skin on opposite sides of your
heart. Hook up the positive terminal of the cell to one needle and the
negative terminal to the other needle.

I don't know where you get your ideas, but an inverter is used to
convert DC to AC.  A rectifier is used to convert AC to DC.

Now you're talking nonsense.  If WiFi has any effect on a GFI, it would
cause it to trip, killing the power to the dryer.  It is simply not
capable of damaging it.  WiFi runs at about the same frequency as a
microwave oven.  If it was transmitting enough power to damage a hair
dryer, it would also be enough power to cook you!

Do you even know what a Ground Fault Interupter (GFI) does?  It detects
when the current in the hot & neutral wires does not balance, indicating
a possibly hazardous leakage.  It then interrupts the power to remove
the hazard.  That is all it does.  It cannot damage a hair dryer, WiFi
fields or not.

I'm not sure what happened here but I just replied to Lennart's post and
then got James and the others posts on this thread. Toasted tower = New
tablet = New learning curve.

I see that most don't buy into my theory and in fact I have a hard time
with it myself, which is why I posted it to the list. Clean power is
important to people, perhaps more so today than at any other time in our
development as human society(ies).

We tend to think of most of the aspects of technology that we use today to
be cut and dried ie. Doctors provide medicine, lawyers provide legal
services etc. However, when you read the fine print you find that a person
is engaged in a medical or legal practice and I simply extend this
postulation to electrical practices.

High tension electrical engineering is a quantative and qualitative
science. However, there is an almost mystical quality to electricity which
only first responding power workers experience first hand. Historically
this resulted in many deaths. Science recorded those experiential outcomes
and has adjusted it's own theories and practices accordingly.

Here is one of my war stories of sustainable development and the grid.

I was working as a lead hand in the construction of a recording studio. One
of my responsibilities was to ensure the control room was acoustically
accurate. ie conforming to specifications. The mixing board was a half
million dollars of solid state logic circuit clusters.

Ontario Hydro promises +- 3% flux in power but when we tested power on our
side of the isolation terminals we were spiking to 7%. Hydro took some time
to sort out what the problem was. Turns out that a auto body shop on the
same street had wired one leg of its welding unit out of phase and it was
sending spikes out all over the place. So instead of directing the owner to
wire it correctly, Hydro ran a new clean leg up to our unit. They did it
hot and in the rain, kudos to their skills and training.

Why, because the cost of using the courts to cause conformity was more
expensive than the kludge they actually implemented. So whenever I'm
discussing power and someone tells me this is the way it is, I find myself
saying, no that is the way it should be.

What a thing is and what it should be are two different things. One is a
theory and one is a fact. Facts which are uniformly agreed upon are
considered to be the status quo. Here is the status quo of north Americas
power grid as expressed by a British engineer lo these many decades ago.
"North America was wired with a great deal of optimism and little regard
for the common earth."

So in my mind every poorly grounded home or miswired factory on the load
balanced grid is a potential source of problems which are not necessilarly
going to manifest themselves in an easily discernable manner. Converting
60hz to 50hz can be done at any point in the grid if the proper equipment
is installed and could do a lot to clean up errant spikes which could
adversely affect expensive computer controlled equipment.

One of the first things a welder learns is how to orient themselves in
respect to the unit so they don't cook their liver when they operate the
equipment.
If a programming environment may be described as an ecosystem, which it
often is, can we not also allow for mystical qualities - that some things
happen behind the scenes and they may be things of which we, as end users,
are not fully aware.

One further point. The current state of EM warfare is so advanced that any
major municipality who is not hardening its grid is doing a significant
disservice to its population. Nothing of what I have said is beyond the
possible realm of the current state of things.

In fact recently 27 US sailors asked to be relieved of duty after a soviet
jet disabled their warship in the black sea. The soviets used an EM weapon
to disable all command and control systems and flew simulated attack
sorties over the ship till they ran out of file and went home.

My theory is that this wired world is not the wired world of even a few
years ago.

I think you misread my original post. I don't have gfi in my unit at all.
Also I use the term inversion to indicate generic change of statefullness.
Rectify is the proper term for AC to DC, I stand corrected.

However as I said it was wi fi which I believe took out the hair dryer.
This is a known and recorded type of event on the North American power grid.
There was a presentation on this at defcon last year.

Please remember there are a lot of volunteer researchers working on this as
we speak. I live in one of the oldest parts of the city and very close to
major switching facilities, so my experiential outcomes are going to be
different than others on the same grid. That is unless you are my neighbour
and we share the same node of the grid.

If you stand directly between the power unit and the anode an interference
field is set up and heats the magnetite present in every living human
cell.  Ask any certified welder, they know the best practices, although

It would have been an interesting article to read if it had been better 
written. That article must have been written by someone who does not 
have English as their primary language. It was so badly written I gave 
up after reading a few bits of it. Even the website domain has "defanse" 
which may be the word "defence" in another language.

True enough it was badly translated. It was one link of many I just now
sourced using key words. Obviously US mil says one thing, Soviet says
another. There are sufficient diverse reports from various news sources
that a person may be able to come to their own conclusions, if they are
trying to formulate an informed opinion.

I'd just like to say that it is not my practice to just spew uninformed
rhetoric, although to the uniniated it may look like that is exactly what I
appear to do.

I raise questions which interest me and which I spend time trying to find
reasonable explanations for. I do this by exposing my own experiential
outcomes to discussion, on this list and elsewhere.

Notwithstanding that I am a lousy speller myself, I'm not going to discount
an opinion just because of bad English. In this world of diversity, the
sovereigns English can take a back seat to informed ideas any day of the
week.

I haven't had any problems with cheaper Class 10 cards, even for long
term use, but I should note that Canada Computers has a special on
Kingston Ultimate microSDs this weekend. It brings them down to within a
couple of bucks of the price of regular cards.

Where do you dig up this nonsense?  The only way to convert 60 Hz to 50
is with a device designed to do that.  Years ago, that meant rotary
converters, that is a motor tied directly to an alternator, with the
appropriate number of poles to do the power conversion.  These days,
electronic converters can be used to do the same thing and with better
frequency accuracy.  If anyone tried to drag the power line frequency
down to 50 Hz, they may get a visit from the power utility.

Electronic warfare generally take significantly more power than you'd

The power distribution network hasn't changed that much in several years.

Just consider the power levels involved.  A hair dryer is typically a
hundred watts or more.  WiFi is a small fraction of a watt.  There's
absolutely no way a WiFi access point can generate enough power to
damage a hair dryer.

You keep on proving your ignorance.  Electronic devices, including
computers, have lots of filtering to prevent RF from entering or leaving
the device.

Peter Hiscocks is on this list.  Perhaps you should run your ideas past
him.  He's an engineer and, IIRC, used to teach at Ryerson.  I also
studied Electrical Engineering at Ryerson and have many years experience
in the telecommunications and computer fields.

Any references regarding this interference field and its effects?
I found some mention of problems with pacemakers which seems reasonable.
I'm curious about other effects or complications though.

Also the magnetite present in every living human cell?

I had a Pi running happish on a class 4, if I recall correctly... I just
mounted the root file system read only and created a small ramdisk to /tmp.
Whenever I needed to change something I would remount it rw, change,
reboot. Before that the card would be killed every other week, every time
the Pi suffered a power failure. Probably a slow card cannot flush the
cache fast enough.

But I don't own it anymore, I sold it to a friend and now I am a proud
owner of a cubietruck.

Actually it does look credible.  But we're not talking about a Wi-Fi
router in the next room... more like a 50cm directional antenna with a
custom RF circuit.  But with that, it appears you can incite the coil
in a GFCI-equipped hair dryer (one that has a very large plug) to fire
(and destroy it's GFCI capability in the process).

Some very big interconnects disconnected due to overloading.  This left
the grid in three isolated parts, one with over supply, one with under
supply and one that was pretty well balanced on its own.

It was all triggered by a misconfigured main link where one end had
different limits configured than the other end, so one end thought
shutting down a parallel line would be fine, but the other end tripped
due to misconfigured limits for the line, which then dropped all the
load on yet other lines, which then tripped, and bye bye grid.
Fortunately it only took about 45 minutes to restore everything.

Well I suppose that with the main distribution being 3 phase power,
but only running 2 phase power in residential areas (which I believe
is generated by transformers from just 1 of the 3 phases in the main
distribution, called I believe split phase, using a centre tap to ground
to give the 2 phases, 180 degrees apart), does result in a potentially
quite unbalanced grid, where the 3 phases could get rather out of balance.
I have no idea if this really results in a big load imballance problem
in general, or not.

gfi is ground fault interrupter after all, so anything other than a
short to ground is not supposed to trigger them, while even a trivial
amount of power going to ground should trigger it instantly.

The reference to magnitite dates back to high biology from the seventies
for me, although I did find one rather obscure video where the researcher
refers to this effect. If I can find the link I'll post it. As for WHIMIS
for welders you should be able to find plenty of info on that. Don't have
any handy links at this time.

It does require a little bit of care in planning to make sure the loads
on all of the phases are reasonably well balanced, but isn't a huge
problem. You might want to avoid large inductive loads on one branch,
though.

The Strachan switchyard near where the OP lives is under huge load with
all the new condos nearby. I wouldn't be at all surprised if its power
quality wasn't quite to standard.

and they are testing it now. I live next door to the test bed and I

Hmm, though that?s reported through a very ?lolwindpower? filter.
Perhaps a more balanced summary is
http://www.euractiv.com/energy/german-energy-giant-blamed-power-failure/article-161312,
which describes the situation as:

1) E.ON Netz has a request to de-energize a major power line at a
certain time to let an unusually large ship pass underneath. The grid
operator does a simplistic calculation to show that it?s okay if all
contingency transmission is available. Neighbouring transmission
authorities are alerted, as is normal procedure.

2) The ship is delayed, and so is the downtime. E.ON Netz considers that
the new proposed time will be better for them, so without any further
analysis or consultation with neighbouring transmission authorities,
goes ahead with the delayed downtime.

3) The other transmission authorities see large frequency instabilities,
and try to get E.ON Netz to restore the de-energized line. They can?t do
this, so they call upon a contingency transmission station to switch the
load. The TX station (rather aptly named Borken) is under maintenance,
so the bridging/switching fails.

4) In Germany, most wind power facilities are ?must run?, so on a windy
night their output ramps up. This seems more of a failure of grid
protection and control (P&C) to signal the wind facilities to curtail
them off in an abnormal grid situation. The ENTSO-E report further
castigates E.ON Netz for failing to require suitable P&C on wind
facilities in their area.

The main report is as interesting as any network failure postmortem
could ever be:

OK this reminds me of another war story from my lifes experiential outcomes
and the wired grid.

I was sitting in a friends apartment one dark and stormy night when I
noticed severe sparking from the overhead power lines. Now I'm not an
alarmist and after several decades working in sustainable development I
have developed certain commnication skills and I convinced dispatch that
this was excessive sparking so they sent out TFD.

Now what I hadn't told dispatch was that my concern was based on the
knowledge that this particular building had two loads coming into it, one
for one municipal address and one for the one we were in. The caveat: the
developer had severed the power to the other address. So what is the issue
you say. All the copper grounding throughout the building. You recall a
previous comment on ground and optimisim I made. Also this was around the
time all the downtown electrical leaks were happening.

So TFD showed up, I related my concerns and was received with skeptisim and
disbelief by the crew. That is until they got a call to a house a block
away about the power being out. So I went over with them to see the cause
of the outage.

It's one thing for the connections to sever at the tap and fall to the
ground than it is the other way round. Obviously one feeds the wet ground
with current, the other doesn't. Ask any worm picker why they plug a 12v
car battery into the ground after a rainstorm and they'll tell you they
tickle the worms to the surface.

So at this point in the tale you are left with the same questions the fire
department had, what did one event have to do with the other.

Well we reverse engineered the time of my call and the time of the other
call to figure the arcing from the service wires to the trees in front of
my friends apt happened at approximately the same time.

How does copper ground wires throughout a two story house factor in. Well
think of delta confiuration on a balanced polyphased distribution grid. All
those above ground copper tendrils acted as a homing beacon for the wave
which was trying to find it's way home via a center tap. It wasn't
traveling from the service to the trees, it was traveling from the ground
to the center tap via the trees.

The fire department guys couldn't figure out how Ontario Hydro got to the
second call before they did. The first response crew got their yuks at the
expense of the second crew, snowing them about who I was and what I was
doing there. I kept my mouth shut, either you have enough grounded
knowledge to know what is possible or you don't. For myself, I'm always
exploring what I don't know and this is what makes hacking fun for me.

FTW means fix the world, not fuck the world. So I fix what I can and ask
for help with the rest.

Close to twenty years on this list and I've learned a lot and helped a
little, at least that's what I hope for, but it is what it is as they say.

For those who don't send my posts to /dev/null I'll have an update on MP
bios follies and the fate of the Toshiba satellite Peter gave me. The issue
is whether to use an inductive or a deductive solution after trashing the
HD by using it as a case thermometer.

Peace out.

This is an important topic.

"Keeping time in sync" is a cornerstone to technology from gps to ssl, from
hft to big data.

I was sent back to school recently when I saw "chrony" and not ntp on my
centos 7 box. I'm not sold yet. And i've not finished reading the horrible
documentation for it.

" The NTP time stamp is part of how equities firms show that trades took
place when they say they did" - False. Ntp is not precise enough.

My finance client's use ptp not ntp.

Yes, residential distribution is just a single phase, center tapped. 
While only one phase is used in an area, other phases will be used
elsewhere with the loads approximately balanced.  In fact, in some
areas, 3 phase is run at high voltage, with the distribution
transformers, along the line, connected across different phases   The
centre tap results in the phases being 180? apart at the customer.  The
advantage of this is the neutral current will be the difference of that
in the two "hot" lines.

Why do they need 50 Hz power?  Streetcars run on DC.

Well, you can start with the ferrite chokes that are on many power
cords.  Then look at all the capacitors in the power supplies and on the
circuit boards.  The bigger ones are to help maintain the DC voltage. 
The smaller ones are there to reduce high frequency noise.  There is
also shielding to block RF in both directions.

Message-ID: <CAPik5MwgbvVgER5bQdcLBxgK1O+zRCo7BU1oOZcTn_ppE4cS+g@mail.gmail.com>

Since this weekend seems to be my hackers holiday at home, no fires, no
fude's and no FUBAR, I thought I update the progress on the Toshiba laptop
Peter offered up to the list.

When last hacked I had XFCE running on Light DM with a small ram upgrade.
Still not enough to force the video aperture to 64mg but videos played well
and the system did not appear to overheat.

Then I got cocky. I had fixed the dsdt tables but still couldn' connect to
the apic timer. Everything seemed stable so I installed Chrome. The rest
happened so quickly I didn't even have time to say this does not look good
and presto, one cooked drive.

I had acquired the other Toshiba I was helping my friend with when he got
tied of failing to get the battery to charge after installing Windows 7. So
I had another drive to tinker with but there are two important differences
in the laptops. The one Peter gave me has single core and runs without the
battery being installed, the other one is quad core and will not start
without a battery being present.

So what to do, experiment with the other drive or something else, I went
with something else. I removed the drive, removed the battery, removed the
wifi and booted. The unit fails to register the realtek Ethernet and loops
the message but the unit stays alive.

So now I have a fairly quiet three port USB charger. Oh yea, I also have
the unit sitting on a USB cooling base with he access plates removed from
the base but this is for the next part. Sugar on a Stick. This is the base
OS for the one child one computer project. For some reason this OS requires
the battery to be installed in it. I imagine that is because of the form
factor for the prototype laptops which appear to have a perminent built in
battery.
So the upshot is Sugar runs fine, no Ethernet as of yet but the unit itself
is quite stable. Hours of use and I've left it on overnight. No freezups,
crashes or chokes the next day and no excessive heating. No temp gauge but
by hand it feels a lot cooler.

So I will probably upgrade the ram at some point which will increase the
video aperature to 64mg and try a full fedora with LDXE or something
similar.

So thanks to Peter, it's lodes of fun and keeps me out of trouble. Well for
the most part anyway.
:-)  Russell

Absolutely. At the solar plant I audited the other week, I was amused to
see that the great big huge expensive grid protection and control box
was controlled via GPS sync. It's the cheapest way to maintain grid
frequency at the far end of the grid. And I mean /far/; 5 hours west of
Thunder Bay ?

Is PTP particularly hard to use? It looks like an ISO standard, so will
likely be fiddly but complete.

It certainly was a number of things done wrong.  Hopefully they have

That is much better than the link I found first, which had a very
serious bias problem.

Out in the middle of the Pacific???  The left coast is only 3 hours
behind.  A wavelength at 60 Hz is 5000 Km, though a bit shorter in power
lines.  With 3 phase power, there are 6 points within the cycle where
sync can occur, so power phase will never be more than +- 30? out of
sync, even before adjusting the alternators.  So this means syncing 5000
or 10000 Km away is no different than 833 Km.


For many years the LORAN C navigation network was used as a time base
for the telecommunications industry to sync the telecom network. 
However, it only provided an accurate time base clock, not time of day.

Correction, that should be 417 Km.

Years ago, 'FTW' used to have a very negative meaning: 'f**k the world'.
This was a term commonly used by social rebels, anarchists and

No mention at all of "fix".

I may have misspoken a bit about the purpose of the GPS. It's for
keeping the phasor* measurement unit (PMU) in sync. These units report
back to the system operator so that early signs of grid problems (and by
early, that would be a few seconds) can be managed remotely. PMUs were
required after the 2003 blackout: there was no shortage of diagnostic
information after that outage, but most of it had imprecise time
stamping, so was of little use to the postmortem investigation.

Here's the PMU that every wind and solar project seems to use:
https://www.selinc.com/synchrophasors/

It's not as pretty as the Synchronome clock that hangs in the board room
of the IESO in /redacted/ (one is not supposed to know where their HQ
is: it has no sign, is heavily armoured, runs on positive pressure,
etc.) which was used to manage The Hydro's grid. The SEI unit is a
little easier to interface to than the Synchronome's invar pendulum, though.

Large solar inverters synthesize their power waveform by copying the
incoming waveform. Unless they are tightly controlled, they'll happily
act as little repeaters for any sync problems.

cheers,
 Stewart

Accuracy numbers in PTP are measured in nanoseconds, while the NTP world
talks milliseconds.  So if you have that sort of accuracy requirement
(power system phasors, etc) you probably want PTP with the appropriate
dedicated hardware, while garden-variety Unix admins just want log
records to show up with the right second.

There is PTP support in Linux, but you need an Ethernet card with the
right timestamping feature plugged into a switch that does PTP too.

Meanwhile, ntpd is getting a bit long in the tooth[0] and the ntimed
project looks interesting.

  Two issues... more people and more power usage per person.  My war
story.  I used to work at the Environment Canada building on Dufferin
just south of Steeles before I retired.  The building went up around
1969/1970, and was planned in the 1960's, to meet 1960's needs, with
"sufficient spare capacity" ha ha ha.  The building had been designed to
support an IBM clone mainframe.  As part of the plan some scientists and
their CS support staff and some other staff had real honest-to-goodness
"green screen" Volker Craig dumb terminals.

  I arrived there almost exactly 30 years ago, in March of 1985.  At
that time "the PC Revolution" was just getting underway.  I remember my
management agonizing about whether they should get me an IBM PC with a 5
*MEGABYTE* add-on drive, or an IBM PC-XT with a built-in 10 *MEGABYTE*
hard drive.  They eventually got the PC-XT.  Fast forward a few years,
and you're looking at several hundred people, each with a desktop
computer, plus a monstrous monitor.  And they all needed power.

  Needless to say, the building was running rather close to power
capacity.  It took a a couple of years to get the building upgraded, and
I assume that Toronto Hydro had to upgrade equipment on their end.  I
don't remember any blackouts due to that issue, but I got the impression
from management that we were running close to the edge for a couple of
years.

I have been inside there a few times with my work.  It's located at
Lakeshore Rd. and Winston Churchill, in Mississauga.  It's hardly a
secret though.  I knew about it years before I ever set foot in the
place.  You forgot to mention the bollards that are dropped down to
allow vehicles to enter the property.

I remember the campus well, I use to drive by it all the time whenever I
was involved in a project in that region.

Here's a bit of wifi trivia. For some reason 1978 comes to mind but I could
be off for a decade or so. However the story starts here. Nikola Tesla
approached the US government some time after the first world war and
demonstrated some of his RC stuff. The military liked the tech but drew the
line at Tesla's claim that even the power for the armaments themselves
could be broadcasted.

Fast forward to the Environment Canada Dufferin Campus in the present day;
it was two EC researchers who proved Tesla's concept by flying a small RC
aircraft in a circle over that location for 24 hours with power broadcasted
to it by microwave. They landed after 24 hrs and said that was enough time
to prove they could go on indefinitely and for reasons of community safety
they ended the experiment.

Sixty or so years from first inception and iteration to proof of concept.

At least professor Higgs got to see his boson spring to life. I'll always
remember this quote attributed to Tesla when a reporter asked him about all
the publicity Marconi and Edison were getting at the time. He said, and I
paraphrase here; let them have it, between them they use 14 of my patents.
I am for the future.

Clearly this was a man who knew who and what he was and as any one who
knows his full story could attest to, his own purpose in life.

In today's wired world we are touched by Tesla technology every day. AC is
still the wild west of power transmission. I mean when Swedish technology
can sneek stuff onto vulnerable tech via the wired grid, what do the WiFi
possibilities become?

"There is PTP support in Linux, but you need an Ethernet card with the
right timestamping feature plugged into a switch that does PTP too."

You can do PTP over IP but I understand you can also deploy "dedicated"
networks that JUST do PTP ( no ip ).

It is the dedicate nets you are talking about ?

The sexiest PTP hardware I've seen is the solarflare stuff.

For myself I recall the phrase as fix the world and as coming from class
discussion on topics of the day.  Rosa Parks and civil rights, Vietnam and
the returning disenfranchised vets, Nixon and Watergate, IBM IT&T and Hal
Geneen, Hal Banks and the CSU and all the other stuff that served to sprout
the phrase; well maybe I can't change the world but I can change my little
part in|of it. This was the antithesis to Timothy Leary and "turn on, tune
in and drop out."

Also "for the world" is kind of an incomplete thought. It requires context.
Fix the world is clear. As is its antisocial counterpart.

As a metasploit I could say it like this. As a thought put down in writing,
what comes before "for the word" The answer is "nothing" therefore the
phrase truly means "nothing for the world." Clearly not the authors intent.

Neither fix nor fuck when used this way, may be given an opposite or false
meaning without additional word modifiers serving to change the context of
the underlying thought.

Again the eternal child in me is just crying out for me to say; in this
brave new holographic universe perhaps "Fork The Word" is more appropriate.
As in, if we could compile the OS and enumerate all the UART's properly at
runtime, then find the right tic on the omnibus, all the worlds problems
would just disappear.
Apologies to Arthur C. Clark who first planted that thought in his Sci Fi
story "The Nine Billion Names Of God."

I have to say the Toshiba hardware is a cut above any of my other
reclamations to date. I'd of happily under clocked this unit to keep it
functional. I like the form factor a lot and as I said Sugar runs fine.

On another note, in respect of one of the laptops you surprised me with
when I picked up the Toshiba. Project reflow video is on the back burner
after certain classified materials were discovered. Construction of the
fume hood has stopped and I am engaged in a strict social contract to not
Frankenstein any electronics in food preparation areas.

Curses foiled again. Its kind of like the time my dad caught me doping the
tissue paper wings of a Folker BiPlane in my room with the windows closed.
However in this case no lecture needed. I am after all, not completely
intransigent to reason.

I hav en't even looked at the HP yet except to confirm; yep that's one dead
battery.

Many hours of fun left in the tickle trunk now, so my thanks and regards.

Russell,

What's with the change of font sizes in the majority of your posts to
this list? You have a small font on some paragraphs and then a larger
font on others. Is this something you're doing intentionally?

Maybe it's just how it's presented on my end using the Gmail web
reader. Anyone else seeing this?

Is there any way you can change to plain text only posts?

PTP at IP (layer 3) still needs hardware-based (PHY or MAC level)
timestamping in order to achieve O(nanoseconds) and O(ppb) performance in
phase and frequency.  The best performance is achieved with this support at
every link that time sync data traverses.

Telco nerds use Synchronous Ethernet besides...

I'm  not sure whats happening to the rendering. I'm not doing any thing
regarding format myself, just using phablet defaults. No irregular font
sizes in my display. The quoted text is in one colour, new text in another.
I thought issues of plain text v html were sorted when the mailserver was
upgraded. Just checked this with my samsung and no issues for my display on
this device either, so for the moment I dont know what's going on.

OK just checked the rendering of sent messages on this phablet and sure enough I noticed a slight difference in font sizes. Those with better eyesight might quibble over my use of the word slight but I digress here. 

I think the last time this was an issue with mail for me was when majordomo was choking on mime attachments to HTML messages, hence the mail server upgrade.

Same solution this time. Abandon the natively provided gmail, which compels the sender to HTML and use K9 Mail, which does not.

Retro thanks to Mario who provided this mail agent suggestion the last time when a varient of the IFS VAR was trashing googles servers and borking mail sent via gmail in general.

On another note, I notice Debian implemented dash to try to deal with exploits. Does anyone know offhand what Fedora has implemented, or is all this handled through SElinux policy management?

Subject: [GTALUG] Keep X from going to sleep
Message-ID: <CAGMvh24tMw=0U7qX1TC3vAn2vc-MD6kVpHVY-aYzJ9=_3of8=A@mail.gmail.com>

Here's a problem I'm hoping to solve:

When idle for some amount of time, X shuts down the screen.  When a
program like VLC is playing a video (or even paused) this does not
happen.

How can I tell X to never sleep?  I just want it to send output down
that cable, constantly, forever.

I manage screen burn and power wasting by turning off the monitor, but
when the screen goes to sleep, my inexpensive monitor (an LG)
sometimes has trouble noticing and won't display anything until X is
restarted, which is a pain.

Thanks!

PS  The system is Debian testing.

Probably not a X configuration, but a WM. What WM are you using?? You need to check the Power Save options, or something like that (depending on which WM).

There are two primary controls which can blank the screen. One is the
screen saver widget the other is power management. Obviously the screen
saver can display an image but it can also just blank the screen. Power
management can spin down drives etc. but it also can blank the screen. If
you access both of these and set each one to never, your screen should stay
lit.

One caveat, for some reason updates of either of these resets the time to
blank the screen to 10 min or so. Or at least it has done this in the past.
With everyone using at least LCD displays now I don't know why the screen
savers ship enabled by default. They were originally intended to stop CRT
burn in. That is if you left a static image on your screen for a
significant amount of time you would actually burn the image onto your
display. I don't believe burn in is a problem these days. My screen never
shut off when my computer is running, sometimes weeks of uptime before I
reboot for one reason or another. Haven't toasted my LCD monitor, yet!
Hope this helps.

The monitor sleep functionality is called DPMS.

At run time you can disable it with the xset command.

xset -dpms

The more permanent option is to create a conf snippet in your xorg.conf.d. 

Once again the arch wiki has great docs. And this specific information will readily translate to debian or any other distro.

Because they evolved into screen lockers.

Much like a key lock on you front door, it's there now to deter invasion of privacy and malicious use of property.

dash is for performance, not security.

As already suggested, xset -dpms and perhaps xset s off, can help, but you
would need to do them after each login, given most window manager/desktop
environments tend to change the values.  I just fixed xfce on one machine
at home yesterday by going into xfce4's power management settings and
turning off putting the display to sleep or off, and no more screen
going to sleep problem.

Well at least with DPMS, making the screen go into power saving mode
does save power, so having it do that by default does sound like a
reasonable thing.

I'm not sure that performance and security aren't interchangable concepts.
While the implimentation of dash did improve performance it did also
mitigate the effects of the Shellshock vulnaribiliy discovered last year.

I agree saving power is a reasonable thing. That's one reason I don't
recommend disabling DPMS completely. Spinning down the drives saves power
and also servs to extend the lifespan of the drive, if only marginally.

Back when I was at IBM, we were required to have our desktops lock up
automatically.  There were security people wandering around to ensure
this was done.  For my computer, I made a bitmap of my desktop and had
it display when the "screen saver" kicked in.  So, to anyone passing by,
it looked as though my computer wasn't locked and they'd have to check.  ;-)

That's a good point.  My drives don't spin, but it's still a good
point.  If my monitor would acknowledge the signal coming in when I am
typing and staring at a blank screen, I wouldn't bother with this.

I am using SSDs, and the computer wakes up fine on keypress, but the
monitor stays stubbornly dark.  What I currently do is Alt-Tab over to
a terminal or fire one up using F1 (mapped in my Openbox config) and
type pkill Xorg.  Then the screen wakes up and shows me the console,
and I restart X and firefox, which asks me if I want to restore 71
tabs :-)

Some of the drives I have had last the longest never spun down.  I had
an 18GB quantum fireball that ran for 82000 power on hours before the
bearings started sounded so bad you didn't want to be in the same building
as the drive.

71 tabs you had pinned or 71 new tabs?

For the longest time SElinux, which a friend uses in Fedora, was choking on
colourd. Notwithstanding that the Nvidia driver was a little problematic to
install, it was better than the native nouveau drivers Fedora was shipping
at the time.
Around the time of Fedora 18, chrome would start and then download a 1mg or
more file to a folder. Then an automatic update fixed the problem so I
didn't have to look into it too much.

Colord is responsible, in part, for defining the neutral palate that all
else is rendered against in the display.

You are on testing so I'd either regress to stable unless there is a good
reason not to or, have a look for colord debug notes in the logs.

There is that factor as well. The hardest thing on any vehicle is that
first start in the morning. Little lubrication, not at optimum operating
temperature etc. I don't think anything in life is really either or, it's
more like if and when.

Well, if you examine the package information about Dash, the description
is reasonably specific...
https://packages.debian.org/sid/shells/dash

"The Debian Almquist Shell (dash) is a POSIX-compliant shell derived from ash.

Since it executes scripts faster than bash, and has fewer library
dependencies (making it more robust against software or hardware
failures), it is used as the default system shell on Debian systems."

I agree that performance is somewhat related to security; a denial of
service can result from poor performance.  But the above seems to be
descriptive of why Dash was chosen as the default shell in Debian
post-Squeeze.

Fewer library dependencies is an interesting additional property.
That is presumably "more secure" as well, but I think they were after
"more reliable" which, while not unrelated, is a distinctly separate
measure.

I think what is important to remember is that most recently discovered
exploits were in fact known at one point or another, at least to the
original authors of the code, if not necessarily documented and shared. How
much information is shared between allies and foes is usually a matter of
operational security.

I believe that Debian has moved towards implement Dependency Based Booting
with an eye to, at sometime in the future, compiling the OS each time at
runtime.

In this case brevity would be a factor in the time it takes to initialize
key security layers and foiling "injected" exploits as opposed to
"discovered" ones. However, too much simplicity can lead to security holes
and other hidden features.

I tend to disagree that reliability and security are distinctly separate
and measurable. Each may be quantified as a measure of trust in
relationship to the other and acted upon accordingly in relation to any
OPSEC priorities.

Just however many tabs were open when killing X took out Firefox, so
it asks me (very pleasantly, I think) if I want them back.  I usually
do.

I just checked some exploits from the last year. There is one WiFi attack which targets the red wire of video, in effect capturing frames which are carried on it. It is a directed attack, but what I'm getting at is that there may be a possibility of RF interference. I remember back in the say that running cable for IBM token ring networks was problematic if the wiring ran parallel to AC carried over Romex wiring and completely FUBAR crossing near florescent lighting. 
So your cables are all neat and tidy and not close to ac cables, lighting ballasts or compact fluorescent lights, and in a place with relatively modern and properly grounded power, right.
If so I think its possible that on wake events, the palate Damon doesn't release the blank screen, which is a signal of its own, rather than the lack of a signal, as we tend to assume that's what a nothing is.

I have an old generic laptop with a dead screen, and I wired it to my TV
using the hdmi port. Some times the screen does not come back too, and I
discovered that pressing ctrl-alt-f1 and ctrl-alt-f8 it comes back without
having to kill X.

I'm using alpine.  It runs in an xterm.

In the message I'm replying to, I cannot tell the quoted text from the new 
text.

This may be a "feature" of gmail.  I'm not sure what
"X-Mailer: Airmail (286)" signifies in Marcelo's email.

I had the same problem with Russell Reiter's postings.  Russell's
postings may have been fixed by his recent switch to k9.  I don't know
since now he's "top posting" (which I think is unfortunate in a
mailing list).  He previously responded-by-chunk, which I think is
great EXCEPT when quote and response are indistinguishable ("red"
doesn't work in plain ASCII).

Here's what I recommend:

- quote relevant chunks of what you are replying to

- add your response after the relevant chunk

- make sure that the quotes and replies are distinct, even in ASCII

- don't quote parts that you are not responding to

This is one way to be considerate of your audience.

Regardless of what I just said, I'm top-posting for this one example
so that you can see what I see.

Sorry I tend to top post when I hurry around and try to reply to topics as well. I often forget that others besides the intended recipient get the messages too. 
Hopefully my replies from this mobile device are now colourless as well.

My impression is that he's got some points but his over-all point is
unconvincing.

1. share buy-backs are questionable
===================================

Share-buy-backs do seem to be incentivized by stock options.  That
seems really really goofy.  When shares are bought back by the
company, the share price rises.  So stock options become more
valuable.  It might have US tax advantages (I don't understand the US
tax system).

The straight-forward approach would be to issue dividends.  But the
current business culture reads an increase of a dividend to be a
commitment to continue paying that dividend until the company cannot
prudently do so (which, in turn, is taken as a very bad sign).
There's a simple cure:  declare an extraordinary dividend.  But
dividends don't get paid to holders of stock options.

Bingo: management (which holds stock options) wants share buy-backs.
For its own reasons, not those of the owners of the company.


2. companies should retain their earnings
=========================================

This is the real point he is trying to make.  He claims this will lead
to long-term employment, investment in employees, and cumulative
incremental R&D.

I don't see the connection.

If a company can see how to use (invest) money well, it should keep
it.  If it cannot, it should pay it out to shareholders.

I don't see any way that Apple can usefully invest $100 billion.  So
paying out a large chunk of it makes sense.

Back in the golden era that Lazonick harks back to, Bell Canada
generated pots and pots of money.  Rather than paying it out to
shareholders, it bought a bunch of businesses and proceeded to kill
them.  Shareholders would have been much better served by receiving
larger dividends that they could choose to invest more wisely than
Bell Canada.

Stable monopolies are the businesses that most closely match what
Lazonick wants.  Such monopolies are generally a bad thing for the
obvious reasons.  They do have pleasant side-effects: nothing has
matched Bell Research Labs, IBM Research Labs, or Microsoft Research.
And the job security is kind of nice.

I don't imagine that Microsoft or Bell management felt they got their
money's worth out of their labs in terms of new business lines.  They
got it in prestige, if anything.


3. R&D needs stable employment
==============================

See Bell Labs and Microsoft Research, above.

Yet those were always the exception.

Why have a screwed up phone system or a screwed up software ecosystem
just to nurture those exceptions.  Seems like a bad tradeoff.

I find Christensen's "Innovators Dilemma" pretty convincing.  Routine
improvements can and do come from within companies but breakthroughs
are better exploited by new companies.

Bell Labs invented the transistor.  Who exploited it?  Sony, at first.
Then everyone.  Including, but not especially, Bell.

Unix is the same.

The Bell Labs discovery that the universe is about 3 degrees?  I don't
know of a product there.

IBM Research arguably invented RISC.  Yet IBM's RISC products were
kind of late and kind of messy.  They are one of the last RISCs
standing so that says something.

I don't know of blockbusters from Microsoft Research.  There certainly
are good people there.


2.  What innovations matter?
============================

The most rewarding innovations are creating or destroying busness
models and monopolies.  Hardly technical in the TLUG sense.

"Intellectual Property" (I hate that term) seems to be key.  Apple
wins here.

Monopoly platform: iTunes, App Store, iOS, ...  EBay, Uber, ...

Monopoly service: google search + ads, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft
Office.  Facebook, ...

Destroying business models: Red Hat (eats Sun etc.).  Netflix (eats
many players).  Amazon (eats book stores and store fronts in general),
...

Maybe all those are exceptional, like lottery wins.  They are what gets 
the most ink.  Where do the important but less spectacular innovations 
come from?  What nurtures them?

Certainly not.  Debian does binary distrubition and to do anything else

Good grief, try compiling kde each time you boot.  Not going to happen.

  That may not be necessary.  I experience "similar" behaviour, but the
answer to that is *NOT* to restart X.  Basically, X has told the monitor
to not merely blank the screen, but to shut down altogether.  When that
happens to me, and I come back from a distraction elsewhere, I merely
reach for the "Power" button on the monitor, and toggle it back on
again.  It's that simple.  Try it.

I think you miss-presume that technology will stay at current levels and
that capacity planning is done the week before instead of the decade before.

Reminds me of Bill Gates, no one is going to need more than 640k, or IBM's
forecast that the entire worlds computing would be done on one or two of
their mainframes.
>

Says you.
I'm not even going to mention VLIW, concurrency booting in failover,
control granularity on process exit, or the fact that the first time I
compiled a kernel on a 486 it took 20 hr's. Want to bet there is one now
that does it in 20 seconds and how long will it be before that is
microseconds.
What's stupid is not engaging possibilities.

The monitor if usually off when the described behaviour occurs.  Even
when it is on, power cycling it has no effect.  It is not that simple.

"xset -dpms" doesn't work, nor does "xset s off", nor does "setterm
-blank 0 -powersave off -powerdown 0"

If these commands are achieving ant result, it is being overridden elsewhere.

Ctrl-Alt-F* followed by Ctrl-Alt-F1 *does* work - thanks to Mauro
Sousa.  It is a nicer kludge, and I appreciate it.  However, I'd still
love to figure out a real, permanent solution, if possible.

The WM is OpenBox, which isn't doing any power management, but I will
see if can get it to invoke a different power manager (XFCE looks
promising, based on Lennart's experience) and try that.  I will report
back.

My impression is that he's got some points but his over-all point is
unconvincing.

Your analysis is quite good and totally agree with what you say. I do however feel you ignored most of the argument and concentrated on last paragraph a little.?

In my opinion, his argument is apple and the like are bad for the ecosystem because they take advantage of US and to be frank other countries without giving back. There is another reason why apple can't give dividends, it would trigger tax against that dividend. That is very questionable for a company that's based close to university of California, a school that used to get a lot of taxes and responsible to lot of law research that apple is currently using.

To me, that was his main argument and in my opinion the biggest drive of the current problems.

Regards,

William

So you want to use all the improvements in technology to do pointless
repetitive work?  Why would you want that.

Debian went to parallel startup to improve startup times.  Your idea
would make it much slower.

Well best kernel compile time I have heard was 7 seconds.  Of course it
was on an IBM p795 with 256 4GHz cores.  That's way beyond what we are
going to have this decade in a typical machine.

Recompiling serves no purpose.  Do you want to first recompile the
compiler before compiling the OS?  What are you going to compile the
compiler with?  How far down do you want to go?  If you want to check
your code, then checksum it and validate that it matches the code last
time you booted and if it does, great, don't bother redoing anything.
If it doesn't match, well then is that because the code is now corrupt
(in which case recompiling is a bad idea) or because you made a change?

Useful uses of modern technology is to make things faster or more power
efficient so they can run longer.  Laptops with 10 to 15 hour battery
lives exist now.  Those we didn't have in the past.  I don't want to
waste that battery life running pointless compile jobs.

I think source distributions like gentoo are stupid, but at least they

Thanks for the feedback.  I wrote a long reply but I think that it was
more for my benefit than the readers so I've spiked it.

He doesn't come up with a way forward that would fix any of these
problems.  Fair enough.  But we're in the current situation due to a
certain regulatory and market regime.  This regime, in my opinion, is
largely better than the good old days.

Some observations seem to call out for fixes but that doesn't mean
that there are do-able fixes that solve the fundamental problem.  The
obvious fixes often have unintended consequences.

The good old days depended on stable corporations.  They were, in many
ways, oppresive.  Much of what most of the big corporations did no
longer needs doing.  And we don't remember the many small
corporations.

Microsoft has been asking for royalties from all sorts of Linux vendors

apply to Android.

Most companies have signed up, as far as we know.

Kyocera has not os Microsoft is suing them for infringement of 6 specific 
patents.  Now we know which they are.  They each look obvious to me but 
apparently that's not the test that is used in the US.

<http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/09/microsoft_lobs_sueball_at_kyocera/>

Apparently Microsoft make billions a year off these.

US patents expire 20 years after filing date.  The latest was filed in 
late 2004 so it runs for almost a decade longer.

Too much of a modern system is in various scripting languages, which
do effectively that everytime you run them.  Granted, so long as you're
not doing tight inner loops in a script the performance hit isn't as
bad as it can be.  Shell scripts that forked N things per loop iteration
used to really crawl along, though the fact we had a couple of dozen
users on a 386 running SVR3 might have had something to do with it too.

Optimization is getting to be a lost art.

Part of the reason I run Gentoo is to have the source code aboard my
system and be sure the binaries were compiled from exactly that; their
infrastructure facilitates that and the build process has to be robust
enough to work on various strange folks' machines.  (The other part was
at the time wanting something as unlike an RPM-based distro as possible
due to having had enough of that for awhile.)

Crazy would be taking something like Debian or Red Hat where you're
supposed to love and run their distributed binaries and recompile them
all yourself and find out how many builds only worked that once and are
irreproduceable.  But someone somewhere has to keep them honest.  :-)

This is an enterprise point of view.  It has validity in its own niche. There are other critical niches which have different aims and security needs. Fire control systems for example.

Lap tops with 10 to 15 hour battery
>lives exist now. 

LI technology has improved in the last ten years and its true those improvements were drive by markets rather than government or national interests but those interests can and will take advantage of those improvements.

Let me put it this way, would you deliberately not take advantage of a secure booting feature which  because of hardware and software improvements, works with little or no added overhead? 

You could do that as a matter of personal preference but in enterprise you would lose market share when your bank clients discover your system is not as secure as your competitors.

>I think source distributions like gentoo are stupid, but at least they
>only compile things once.  They aren't that crazy.  

So you only compile your critical dependency system once at runtime and if and when you make hardware or other critical changes you do it again. There are valid reasons to harden systems and keep them hard. You got 82000 hrs spin time from one of your drives, that's a lot of times between boots.

I don't just pull this stuff out from under my hat you know, I do a lot of reading. Its just that I'm limited to the stuff that's not above my pay grade or not otherwise trade secrets.

I always think of Post It notes. The task was find a superior glue. What was discovered was a reusable tacky substance which official product development channels within 3M would not authorize.  An unofficial "bootleg" channel developed and the product eventually passed back into the corporate development stream.

I guess this was the middle management, who knew more about their staffs capacities and abilities than did the corporate bean counters who's main duties are reporting profits to the board and shareholders.

The willingness to take risks with other peoples money and the checks and balances of the enterprise constructs of risk and reward are the foundation of capitalism. Even in the early days of communism Trotsky acknowledged the need for a class of venture capitalists. He just felt the reward limits for investors be capped in favor of spreading the profits among the workers more equitably.

I always say the real rewards come from thinking outside the box. However there are real and practical circumstances where you don't let some stuff out of the box, or even open it at all.

Remember that if you are testing a virtualized environment your profiles should match real world hardware. For example it might look advantageous to set the baud rate of a virtual disk to 115000, however 9600 is a supported real world rate that won't flood the bus with sync or other requests in difficult circumstances, most especially in a testing environment.

The baud rate on the planar is different than the baud rate of modem communications in dealing with the bus ie. Perhaps it is device limited to requesting and syncing clock tics.

I know this may not seem to relate to the problem at hand but I hear testing, I think testing.

Well there is a difference between not optimizing, and purposely
unoptimizing.

But running gentoo you do not recompile the same code each time you boot.
Just doing it once is sufficient.

Debian even has a "reprodueable builds" project going on, hunting down
any package that generates different result each time you rebuilt it,
and fixing them.

If you want security, recompiling again and again is not a solution,
it is a risk.  Validating your binary with some kind of checksum would
be useful.  Sure you should compile it yourself from validated sources,
and then sign the result, and then leave it alone and just check the
signature each time you boot.

Yes I would.  I despise secure boot.  It has its use in a few special
cases, but the wast majority of places it is being pushed is purely to
try and control peoples hardware.

Of course secure booting relies on signed binaries, and certainly does
NOT support recompiling the code each time you boot.

There is no reason to trust your sources anymore than your precompiled
binary at boot time, hence recompiling is plain stupid and serves no
purpose.  You turn it from a problem of validating your binary, to one
of validating your compiler binary and your source code, and wasting a
lot of time every boot.  Compiling trusted code in a trusted environment
and then signing it and using secure boot to validate the signed binary
and running it does make sense, but compiling multiple times does not.

Well it sure seems like you do a lot of the time.

I dislike the term secure and prefer trust myself however the demands of enterprise are different than my own. The number of compiles is related to the number of boots again IMHO, this is far less of a problem than you would make it out to be.

Well that is your opinion and you are entitled to it.

My opinion is that there is a need and a call for development of a trusted compiler to be used in a security enhanced OS which compiles at runtime and is based on the modular nature of the hardware itself and the needs of the enterprise in question.

You don't need to compile everything *every* time to keep them honest;
you need to compile it *once*.  And it's not so much you as there being
*someone*.  And better still if the "someone" is an automated batch
process so that we can have a non-negligible amount of confidence
that it's repeatable.

And some of the "recompile for (imagined) security" takes this to
further heights of silliness...

- Do we need to recompile Bash (or Dash or zsh or whatever)
  each time we reboot?

- Oh dear, that means we need to recompile the Perl, Python, and
  Ruby distributions every time.  Should we be running the test
  suites, too, to verify that they're working as predicted?

- It seems idiotic to need to recompile KDE, libraries *and* apps.

- I'm running StumpWM as my window manager; this "security
  by recompiling everything" model means I need to recompile
  SBCL (the Common Lisp environment).

- Whoops, can we really trust things if we haven't recompiled
  GCC/LLVM since the last time we rebooted?  If recompiling
  code lends security, then surely not.

- Have you recompiled Grub lately?

And all of this falls out of deciding that when people say
"reliability," they don't *really* mean that; they really mean
"security."  And when they say "performance", they don't
*really* mean that; they really meant to say "security"
(even though they didn't, which ought to be a hint that
it wasn't what they meant).

Claim was made that Debian switched from using Bash
as the default shell (!= "default login shell", by the way)
"because security."  When the declared reasons didn't
have the word "security" anywhere.

But I guess that since *everything* is really computer
security, then the plans must be already well under way
for Debian to recompile everything, from the kernel to
Grub to all the scripting engines during the boot
process.

Sure, but why trust the test suites haven't been tampered with?

But why trust your compiler?  All such a stupid idea is doing is moving
the problem, while putting some stuff in front that sounds like they
are doing something to improve security, while doing no such thing.

There are ways to make sure you are booting trusted code.  Recompiling
from source at boot is not one of them.  It does the opposit in fact.

Yep, that means we need to download the sources of *everything*,
from trusted sources, and check the checksums.  Recursively.
And it doesn't really validate that the test suites are any good,
which is distinct from tampered with...  The only way to be
totally confident the test suites are any good is if you wrote them
yourself.

Yep, it shuffles around the problem, pretending that the compiling
process is a grand protection.

This properly steps us back to Ken Thompson's paper on trust
http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html
where he points out an exploit (discovered by MULTICS folk somewhat
earlier) where a suitably hacked compiler might put arbitrary
exploits anywhere into this process.

And there's actually a tale in the last week pointing to attempts to do
exactly what Thompson is pointing at; it seems as though some TLA
agencies have tried such stunts with some of the Apple compiler
toolchain called XCode.

http://www.macrumors.com/2015/03/10/leaked-cia-documents-hacked-xcode/

Gentoo, at one time, had proponents that would claim no end of
benefits from compiling everything from scratch.  I don't think that's
what it's about now, but at one time, there were plenty of "fanboys"
claiming that they were making their system better and understanding
it better just by virtue of watching the successive series of "make"
output, lines of logs indicating what file GCC most recently compiled,
and with what flags, scroll by.

Pointing back to those fun times, with maximum sarcasm...
http://funroll-loops.teurasporsaat.org/

Watching the compiler 'logging' scroll past doesn't represent
actual understanding.  (And if someone pulled Thompson's exploit
on your compiler toolchain, recompiling ensures INsecurity!)

Instead, I'll step back to Thompson's paper...

"The moral is obvious. You can't trust code that you did not totally
create yourself."

That's a deeper statement than it seems; deep trust requires that
you write your own compiler, your own libraries, your own linker, your own
bootloader, and so forth.

But the shallow interpretation also works decently.  Recompiling
someone else's code using someone else's compiler using
someone else's control scripts doesn't provide deep trust.

If it is a hint then open reasoning is on the table. There is a type of security in obscurity, as witnessed by the discovery of embedded exploits which, by needs, must be addressed by enterprise.

I'm not privy to the inner workings of Debian plans, but all the best planners, I think from the logistic perspective, work on failover and have a contingency for rapid deployment in case a primary plan doesn't work as expected and does indeed fail in service.

This is what government brings to the table that enterprise does not; the willingness to spend large amounts of money on two radically different plans with identical aims.

So if Debian does not have a fully formulated plan to have a compile at runtime OS, I'd bet there is a set of schema on someone's drawing board somewhere.

This whole conversation/hissy-fit is missing yet another problem.  Even Ken
Thompson wrote code with bugs and constructed code vulnerable to
exploitation. I certainly don't blindly trust the code I write - I make the
confident assumption that it is buggy and possibly dangerous. If anyone on
Earth wrote a program that actually addressed my needs I wouldn't be
writing the code at all.

Trusting something so complicated it requires a computer to interpret and
run it is a challenge. Many approaches are being explored, differences of
opinion are being generated constantly.  That's OK.

There are a lot of things that are now standard that are based on history
rather than good theoretical bases.

Let's look at working solutions, ask questions and try to be friendly and a
little more understanding.

There is no right way, and priorities differ.

I wish I could ratchet back the touch sensitivity by a factor or two. Otherwise in landscape mode, its a bit like a Z80 or one of the other first gen personal computational devices. It would also be nice to have something like a double touch perimeter pad to minimize stray touch damage. 

Unfortunately that would require root. I really only have the device for a short time in order to suss out various vulnerabilities under a particular OPSEC requirement.  No hardening just a pen report. 

I know its Android, please don't snicker.

On the upside I'm getting better at two finger typing and at under 200 bucks its full of features, fast and fairly friendly. I may get one myself.

Ken Thompson's classic Turing Award lecture:

Trust is not cheap.  If it looks cheap it may just be gullibility.

I like his tastes quite well!  Apparently I know some obscure
Unix tools!  :-)  And better still, I am not familiar with all of them.
