Thanks!  You present several good choices.

I see that this time we are only allowed to vote for one.
Last time we were allowed to tick more than one.

I'd prefer to see a way of providing more information.  I'm not sure
what it would look like.  Ranking?  Fractional votes?


More details of the choices:

Restaurant Formerly Known As Love at First Bite (Pizza)
	We know this one.  Not bad at all.

Kaiju (Japanese Curry)
	- we went there once before.  Service a bit overwhelmed
	  but very polite and accomodating.

	- one of several restaurants in the food court.
	  + allows alternate choices while eating together
	  + but most are closed at our time

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka
	Japanese noodle soup chain.
	<http://www.santouka.co.jp/en/menu/index.html>	
	<http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-toronto-2>

Lou Dawg's (BBQ)
	We've been there once (some of us more, I think).
	<http://loudawgs.com/home.html>

The Senator (Diner)
	<http://thesenator.com/>
	Apparently the New York Times reviewed it!
	By the prices, I'd call this a faux diner.
	The cheapest entree (today?) is
	"8 oz Cumbrae’s Naturally Raised Beef Burger - $16"
	(Cumbrae is a very well thought of local butcher)

OPA! of Greece Dundas Street (Greek)
	<http://www.opasouvlaki.ca/home>
	A national chain / franchise.  May well be good.

Banh Mi Boys (Vietnamese)
	<http://www.banhmiboys.com/menu.htm>

	I remember discovering Banh Mi on Spadina, near Dundas.
	Amazing sandwiches for $1 or $1.25.  Well they've gone up
	there to perhaps $2 (I haven't looked since TLUG and Hacklab
	deserted the area.

	These guys do an upmarket version.  Surely worth the money.
	But it makes me wistful for the good old days ("more
	authentic").

Hi Alex,

If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

I currently have T43, and its keyboard is difficult to type on, at least
for me.
    - it's stiff, so you need to "push" rather than "tap", 
    - it doesn't spring back, fast enough or "crispy" enough, so you
      actually notice and become aware of the keypresses.  And, that
      interferes with my typing.

Are you able to type fast and comfortably on your T420?

A long time ago (more than a decade) someone used XEmacs as the basis
of a window manager:

It's been pretty much abandoned for the last seven years.

This is more of a test of the LimeSurvey web application.

There is a way to do ranking questions[1] in LimeSurvey so we can try
that next month.

The nearest to "in practice" that has arrived is the series of tiling
window managers
that have UIs loosely similar to GNU Screen.

I'm thinking of ratpoison, stumpwm, dwm, and such.  The model they take
is that windows correspond (more or less) to Emacs buffers, and one's
attachment of a set of buffers to the display (e.g. - which buffers you've
got visible) correspond to a "workspace" concept.

You set up key bindings to let you adjust window ("buffer") visibility on
screen,
and key bindings to let you switch workspaces (which would lead to
displaying
a different set of buffers/windows).

I'm usually using stumpwm these days, almost always with just one workspace,
so that I see one window at a time, switching when I want to head to another
window ("buffer").

That seems to be where control of this has gone.  There may have been some
code around to enable having Emacs talk directly to stumpwm, not obvious
where it is (and I notice that the repo has moved from Savannah to GitHub,
which probably means I need to "rebase" my use of it; I've apparently been
tracking a dead-ish branch).  Direct Emacs integration has gotten pretty
secondary, it seems.

I think I'd be way more inclined to use stumpwm, and have some Emacs
hooks to talk to it (which isn't hard to have) than to talk directly to X
from
Emacs.

I have a new  T440p with 16GB, running Fedora 22, thus far it's reasonable.
I'm a hunt-and-peck person, so the KB isn't a big consideration: it 
works, I'm happy.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs.  Fewer cores and
  lower clock rates, for a start.  There are exceptions but they are
  outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs.  But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
  do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained.  May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
  (but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
  fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware.  Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take 
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts 
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful 
and expandable (may depend on the generation).  My son's W520 will accept 
up to 32G of RAM, I think.  Lennart has a similar one.  And it comes with 
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older

"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is 
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,
many seem fine / good enough.  None has captured me.

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue).  It is fine, but not
a revelation.  I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches.  I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Considering amount of typing I do, keyboard is very important for me.  I
use Topre Realforce keyboard (capacitive key).  It's the most expensive
keyboard, but my wrists would not have lasted this long without it.

I can accept the hassle of external keyboard with laptop... if the
laptop has 16GB.  On my Slackware machine, my ram usage is 8GB (out of
16GB total).  Firefox-31.8.0esr alone is using 4GB!  That leaves 8GB for
VMs.

I have a rather depressing variety of mechanical keyboards, including
a couple IBM Model Ms.  To clarify my biases, I LOVE the feel of the
IBM Model M keys.  My keyboard at work is a Kinesis Advantage with
their standard Cherry Brown switches.  I think the Advantage's
physical layout is about the best that's available in any keyboard
right now: vertical columns (rather than slanted columns we still
persist in copying from typewriters: not only is it no longer
necessary, it's actually ergonomically bad), dished hand areas to
match differences in finger length, and a split between the hands.

I have three Kinesis Advantages.  As mentioned, one has the original
Cherry Browns.  They're okay.  I have a second that I refitted with
Cherry Blues: that's the one I use at home.  That's my idea of a great
keyboard.  The Cherry Blues are about as close as you'll get to the
behaviour of the IBM Model M buckling spring keys (short of buying one
of the Unicomp keyboards that actually have buckling springs).  They
have a strong tactile click when the key activates.  It's also
audible: it's just as well I live alone, as the Blues are notoriously
loud and irritate the crap out of people nearby (just like the Model
M).  I refitted the third Kinesis Advantage with Cherry Clears.
Initially they feel quite similar to the Browns, but they're stiffer:
you don't notice it immediately, but after a couple hours of typing, I
found it genuinely tiring to use.  I don't use it much.

I highly recommend the Cherry Blues to non-gamers.  Just be prepared
for the noise.  The bigger Canada Computers stores usually have
several keyboards with different Cherry switches out for testing.

If anyone has questions about any of this, feel free to contact me
off-list: I've been a bit of a keyboard wonk for a couple decades.

FWIW I have been very happy with my Cooler Master CheeryBrown-based KB
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=21_273_274&item_id=061959

I brought it to work to replace the crap PC standard one that came with the
office PC. Quieter then Cherry Blue but still noisier than the squishy
standard, works just as good for me.

Based on the statuses (e.g. - autoRenewPeriod), nope, they didn't.
The registry did that automatically.  (There's standard policy about that.
See RFC 3915)

I wouldn't assume that all will necessarily "be well"; the DNS info is
pretty
clear about pointing it to a "parking zone".

The bit of being in autoRenewPeriod means things are a bit on "autopilot,"
and I'd kind of expect that the registrar is trying to pester the owner to
pay them.

If the folk managing the domain have forgotten about it, and email
addresses
have changed, and such, then perhaps the warnings of Deletion Coming
Soon will disappear into the aether.

If anyone knows anyone involved (e.g. - perhaps the Shawn Amundson
indicated in contact information in WHOIS), it's probably worth giving them
a poke soon-ish otherwise the domain may go away.  An email address
of form "something at gimp.org" won't work, for sure, right now.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now. But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs. Fewer cores and
lower clock rates, for a start. There are exceptions but they are
outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs. But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained. May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
(but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware. Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful
and expandable (may depend on the generation). My son's W520 will accept
up to 32G of RAM, I think. Lennart has a similar one. And it comes with
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

- quad core i7-4710hq
- 1920x1080 17" IPS screen
- 16G of RAM (that may well be the limit)
- NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX860M Graphics with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM
Beware: bilingual keyboard

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older
ThinkPads. One of the main complaints about newer ThinkPad keyboards is
"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- keyboards are at least partially a matter of personal taste

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,
many seem fine / good enough. None has captured me.

Many typists like being sure when they press a key.

Significant key travel is considered desirable by many (but not all).

A tactile signal of a keypress registering is considered a Good Thing
(except by many gamers). Something sort of lost with most modern
key structures.

There has been a renaissance of mechanical keyboards. They cost
several times as much as regular keyboards. And a great deal has been

Cherry blue, brown, or clear keys.
<http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/>

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue). It is fine, but not
a revelation. I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches. I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Ouch.  This is an argument in favour of having different parts of services
in some different places, particularly email services.

Interesting tool I saw pointed at in the discussion; it offers the ability
to notify SEVERAL people of impending expiries of domains and SSL certs.
    http://www.expirify.com/about/
It of course has some clear "and why should I trust this with anything
important?" issues.

Hi William,

I used to have T42 a few years ago, and after years of abuse the
keyboard on that laptop starter to bend and rattle as I typed, that kind
of annoyed me but that was caused due to wear and tear, although your
keyboard has a different defect, I suspect it was caused by the same
reason. At this point your T43 is 10 years old.

Other than that I would consider thinkpad keyboars as good of a laptop
keyboard as it could ever be -- both for layout (function pgup/down keys
in a separate row) and key travel (it is pretty crisp).

Unlike other laptop keyboards, especially cramped netbook keyboards, I'm
able to type comfortably for extended periods of time without getting
any pain in my wrists, keys are big, far apart and I have sausage
fingers. Still it is not as good as separate keyboard, and a good
computer table/chair combo, as laptops by their design, inherently put
you in a suboptimal typing position, but it is as good as it possibly
gets for a laptop.

I tend to be pretty hard on keyboard so on average I tend to replace the
keyboard on my laptop every few years -- there are three variants. So
far I've used two types -- the only difference I've noticed is in the
design of butterfly mechanism supporting the keys. I've been been
completely contend with both.

https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-76711

Replacing a keyboard on a thinkpad is a really easy thing to do,
instructions for replacing most of the things on thinkpads are available
on lenovo website.

https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-76809


If you're planning to use a T420 as a desktop, I highly suggest you
getting a docking station, you can get one really cheap these days, and
it might support dual external screens.

I just bought a T440p as a dev machine, and am running vagrant -> 
VirtualBox -> CentOS 6 to run in turn a full stack of PostgerSQL,  Java 
on Tomcat, Java and Scala on Play! and angular on the browser.

I barely notice it, and probably will have a couple of inactive VMs set 
up, so I can switch back and forth between unrelated tasks. Build 
performance is good, in part because I'm rarely compiling linking and 
provisioning more than one thing at any given moment! 
Eclipse/Maven/java/Scala are memory hogs, though, so I bought 16 GB of ram.

A much smaller netbook gave good build performance, but was constrained 
to 4 GB, and I needed at least 8 and perhaps 12, so bought a machine 
with slots (;-))

  Hi Abby,

  Googling  UEFI BIOS disable  should bring up quite a few links.  
Unfortunately, there is no standardized way of disabling the UEFI and
switching back to using BIOS.  In general, there are basically two challenges:

  1) getting the attention of the firmware that runs on initial startup
before the operating system (Windows or Linux) gets to start,  and

  2) navigating the setup menus to disable the UEFI.


  Doing the first usually requires you to press or hold down a particular
key at a particular time, which one and when depends upon the manufacturer.
Depending upon a number of factors, you may or may not see a splash screen 
providing a hint while booting.  Knowing the make and model of your computer
can also help to determine this.  Most computer manufacturers should
have user documentation in PDF format that you can download from their
web site.

  I hope that this helps.

Once you find the UEFI settings in the BIOS you may find that access to it 
is disabled. You will most likely need to set a supervisor password for the 
BIOS before it will let you have access to the UEFI settings. Just remember 
to remove the supervisor password when you are done (if you don't want/need it).

Once you find the UEFI settings in the BIOS you may find that access to it 
is disabled. You will most likely need to set a supervisor password for the 
BIOS before it will let you have access to the UEFI settings. Just remember 
to remove the supervisor password when you are done (if you don't want/need it).

Subject: [GTALUG] Ubuntu update gone bad
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1508091030010.25880@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I'm writing this at the point of annoyance.  Maybe I'll find a fix in a 
minute or two.

I took an Acer Revo out of service as an HTPC.  It was dual boot Win 7 and 
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I applied all Win 7 updates.  Fine.  Stupid, but fine.

I applied all Ubuntu 12.04 updates.  Fine.  Not even stupid.

It offered me Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  I said to go ahead.  I almost never do 
version upgrades, out of fear, but I didn't have much to lose.  And 
everyone always says Ubuntu version upgrades are smooth as silk.

Negative observation one: version upgrades take more real time than 
re-installations.  (But they should take less of my attention and care, a 
win.)

Negative observation two: I thought that the slow upgrade process could 
happen while I was asleep.  Yes, but not in one night: there were three 
steps in the middle that required me to answer a question.  It would have 
been better if the questions had been moved to the beginning or the end.  
Fedora does that.

Negative observation three:  It all appeared to work.  The updater 
disappeared from the screen (a little odd).  top(1) showed no remnant.  
So I rebooted.  Now I have the prompt:
	grub rescue>
which means I have nothing, not even Win7.  I don't think that I can type 
anything useful into that prompt.

Obviously the third is the lulu.

The fact that I am using LTS should indicate my risk aversion.

I will fix this but I will remember.

Revos have an EFI bios, right? I used to get this all the time on my
Samsung Chronos, until I blew away the dual-boot and put it back into
legacy (aka "working") BIOS mode.

Boot-Repair <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair> on a
bootable USB stick will likely fix it. Under certain circumstances,
Windows updates will routinely destroy grub, so keep this stick handy.

Message-ID: <20150809195953.7269fdc4ceced4fa6fe554fa@eol.ca>

   I have just installed Fedora_22 on my Lenovo Thinkpad T400 laptop.
I cannot get the networking to work, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.  

   I can turn Wi-Fi on, and I can see the Wi-Fi servers.  When I
connect to mine, it just sits there trying to connect until it times
out.  I tried connecting with an invalid Wi-Fi password, and it
prompted me for the correct one, so it is validating this, but not
connecting.   

   When I look at dmesg, I see a bunch of messages about authenticating
and deauthinticating to a MAC address.  This MAC address matches the
address of my router except for the last number, which is 87, and
should be 86.  Fedora_22 no longer has /var/log/messages. 

   I had some difficulties when I did the install from DVD.  A screen
came up and said "Oh no!  Something has occurred and the system can't
recover. All extensions have been disabled as a precaution."  I
searched the web and I removed xorg-x11-drv-libinput.  This got the
install working.  I removed it from the actual installed computer, as
per the instructions on the website.  I was having network problems
both before and after I did this. 

   Has anybody seen anything like this?  Fedora_20 was a fairly easy
install for ordinary mortals.  Fedora_22 seems to be a huge step
backwards.

   Thanks.

No need for this drastic action.  I've dual booted Ubuntu with Windows 
using EFI without a problem.

Yes, boot repair is an excellent tool.  The other route is to boot off 
of a Ubuntu live cd, click on try Ubuntu and mount your drives to /mnt.  
Chroot to /mnt and try to to reinstall grub.  Look for errors and 
correct them.

I've seen this with Linux Mint Debian Edition (the first release from
March 2014); I bypassed the problem by assigning a static IP address
to the laptop (Asus netbook) for that particular location.

I believe the access point is at fault in my case, since the Asus
netbook has no trouble connecting to APs at other locations.

Message-ID: <CAOO1MfutDkpa6RM2SuK97uUhbP93gyO5zMGXM-wjqct9eE0jGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
I am writing a bourne shell script, to read a binary file as input and take
action depending on the contents of the file.

The file is a mixture of ASCII and binary codes (such as ASCII filed
lengths and flags).

I have the processing already done in C. I would like to convert it to a
bourne shell.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what combination of tools I may be able
to use?

You don't need "tools" to write Bourne shell script, because the script
itself is text file.  If you're talking about shell wrapper, then
    #! /bin/sh
    your_c_program "$@"
would call your C program with the same arguments.  You can use "exec"
to replace the script, if you want PID to be the same, ie.
    #! /bin/sh
    exec your_c_program "$@"

If you're only trying to look at the ASCII data (and trying to process
binary data in Bash seems like a poor idea), then you may want to look
at the "strings" command:

$ strings $(which ls)

"strings" is part of the binutils package on Debian.

If you have the program in C to process data, going to bash is like
swapping a large truck for a turtle. Bash will be orders of magnitude
slower, and you will have to take a lot of care to pipe data all over awk,
sed, tr and the like.
Bash is a terrible choice, python (or perl, or PHP) would be faster. Way
faster.

You jumped over 3 other releases in between. One of which would have been 
another LTS release. I have done upgrades in Ubuntu when I used to run it 
and I usually had no problem. In my case I would do a series of upgrades 
when I only two or three releases behind the current one. If I am too far 
behind then I would go the route of a fresh install.

You are jumping up by four releases and you can find some programs were 
replaced by other programs which can complicate the upgrade process in some 
situations.

Yes, they often can.

I prefer to do the updates during the day so I can keep an eye on it. There 
are extra questions that can be asked of you during an install that would 
bring the process to a halt until an answer is provided.

This could be one of a few issues. It could be a failed update to the grub 
bootloader, it could be the Windows update changed the boot partitions or 
removed the grub bootloader, or possibly a UEFI related boot issue.

If (or, rather when) Windows update messed with the bootloader it usually 
makes it so the system boots straight to Windows. Seeing a grub prompt means 
that is not the case here.

You can go in to the BIOS of your computer and disabled UEFI boot. I ran in 
to an issue with it on one of my systems. If that isn't the case you may be 
able to issue some commands at the grub prompt to get the system to boot.

I don't know if things are the same with grub 2 but in grub 1 you would use 
four commands. "root", "linux", "initrd", and finally "boot" to get the 
system up.

For example:
root (hd0,1)
linux /boot/vmlinuz-<insert-kernel-version-here>
initrd /boot/initrd.img-<insert-kernel-version-here>
boot

The root line would point to the drive and partition containing the linux 
kernel and initrd files (what you know often know as /boot when the system 
is running).

The linux and initrd lines can take command line completion so you can hit 
the tab key to see which kernel and/or initrd files are available. The last 
word "boot" takes no arguments. It uses the information from the first three 
commands and attempts to boot your system.

Message-ID: <20150810200226.GA5950@node1.localdomain>

Hi all,

With Debian, you can install all desktops (kde, gnome, xfce, etc) from
ISO at first, and then choose which the desktop when you log in via
gdm/kdm.

Is there a version for Ubuntu which allows you to do that?
Right now, you have to choose/install different ISO for each desktop.

Or, do I have to start with "minimal install", and then install all
the desktops afterwards?  But, I don't know if gdm/kdm will pick up
the desktops.

I will stick to my keytronic (currently an E03600U2).  I hate the noise
of the old IBMs.  Fortunately the model M is durable enough to
sufficiently punish anyone who tries to use one nearby that the keyboard
won't suffer any damage and can still be used by someone else that
politely does so when they are alone. :)

That is NOT what you want to do.  You want to disable 'secureboot' not
disable 'UEFI'.  Not the same thing.  Nothing wrong with UEFI at all,
just secureboot.

What you want is to enter the setup and find the setting that turns off
secureboot, and that is it.  Booting in UEFI mode is perfectly fine and
most linux distributions have no issue with UEFI (and grub2 works fine
with it too).  UEFI also means you get to use GPT for your partition
setup, which is much nicer than the old primary/extended/logical partition
crap we used to deal with.

If you really want, you can look for CSM (Compatibility Support Module)
boot mode and use that, which should boot with BIOS compatibility services
allowing you to install older OSs that require a BIOS.

Well for Windows 8 certification Microsoft required that there must be
a user controllable setting to turn it off (although it must be on by
default).  I am under the impression that Windows 10 certification no
longer requires that such an option exist, so unfortunately some system
makers might stupidly decide to not have such an option (of course no
sane person should then buy from them, but many people won't know that).

Hi William,

This doesn't answer your original question, but I'd install minimal
system and then install all the desktop environments, because minimal
system is a lot easier to troubleshoot than installer environment.

You then can install all the desktop environments you want with tasksel
tool -- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tasksel

KDM/GDM are smart enough to detect all desktop environment, though you'd
be better off installing only one of these.

https://www.google.com/search?q=kdm+select+desktop+environment&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI76vC4ayfxwIVAxs-Ch05KQA1&biw=1600&bih=728

In debian these days, you can install one of the desktops by just
installing one of the task-desktop packages, I don't know if this method
trickled down to ubuntu yet.

That's nothing compared to the dire and baroque things the coworker who
used to sit across from me was going to do if anyone brought in a Model
M.  Of course, you have to be faster than the proprietor of said keyboard
if you want to do any of that.

At least the Lenovo keyboards work uses consistently hit the minimum
standard for a usable keyboard.  But it seems a shame not to be able to
do my best coding there.  There's really nothing as nice to type on as
a quarter-century-old Model M.

And hey, if I wanted to make noise why bother with a Model M when I can
fire up my chainsaw?  :-)

I also like the M keyboard.  I picked up a few several years ago.  The
only issue was I had to get a PS/2 - USB adapter to use the keyboard
with my KVM.

Message-ID: <CAOO1MfuQyjfN7VTdkSFh=Ho9YjMitwk_9V9AtFJLbkcSiOYCCg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the complete background.

I need to write a tool to run on Linux that will do an LDAP lookup on
Active Directory for a specific 'hidden' attribute that tells the client
which Active Directory site it belongs to. The tool is part of a larger
suite (keytab creation, krb5.conf config etc) already written in Bourne.
Unfortunately, the value that is returned from AD is a binary blob. So
while I can call ldapsearch to retrieve the value, I still need something
to process/decompress the attribute.

The algorithm to decompress the blob is the same as is outlined in RFC
1035. But Windows implementations of such are sparsely documented.

I needed to ensure that I understood the decompression algorithm so I wrote
some fairly portable code to do both the LDAP lookup and  perform the
decompression of the binary blob.
