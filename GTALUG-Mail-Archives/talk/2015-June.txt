If you can, deliver it to FreeGeek. They'll re-use or refurbish it,
and if it's completely unusable they'll take it apart and get a few
semoleans from their upstream recycler.

Better them than a for-profit recycler.

Yes, that is the best answer.

# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

Subject: [GTALUG] Clean Ubuntu Install Tips
Message-ID: <557A10F9.80104@rogers.com>

I have been running Ubuntu for over a decade. Always did Internet upgrades.

But the last one, to 12.04 broke my PHP and the only solution I have 
found is to do a clean install.

I have /home on a separate drive so I expect that this is not a big 
deal. But I think a few of you might be able to offer a tips.

The system will be a desktop and also a LAMP server. I plan to install 
the desktop and then add the AMP.

I will back up the databases using mysqldump, save the Apache .conf 
files as well as fstab.

Anything else I should consider? Thanks

You could use a configuration management system to declare what the 
final state of the machine should be once you've finished. I've been 
learning SaltStack <http://docs.saltstack.com> over the last couple of 
days and I'm quite impressed. I'm using a masterless minion setup due to 
the fact that the machines that I'm deploying are intended to run behind 
a firewall with no access to the Internet. Here is a resource I found 
useful: 
<http://eon01.com/blog/using-saltstack-to-automate-vagrant-provisioning/>. 
You don't have to use Vagrant but you might want to once you see how 
easy it is to go from deploying your VM locally on VirtualBox to 
deploying to an Amazon EC2 instance, for example.

That might be a simple way to try and fix things but I wouldn't think it 
should be the only way.

You don't say in which way it is broken. You could downgrade PHP, remove all 
packages that have anything to do with PHP and reinstall from your distros 
PHP package, or you could remove all existing PHP packages and install a 
version you built from source.

Another thing is whether the problem is simply a configuration error in 
Apache. You can run some tests on PHP using 'php -a' at a command line to 
run it interactively and see if it appears to be functional or not.

I have tried many things. The problem comes when trying to install 
libapache2-mod-php5

I get this error:

dpkg: error processing package libapache2-mod-php5 (--configure):
subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
libapache2-mod-php5
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Using Google I see others have had this problem, but I have not found a 
solution.

I have followed suggestions like these (using sudo):

apt-get -f install
apt-get clean all
apt-get update

apt-get -f install

Then try:

apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

I get the error above.

Follows is the term.log:

I suggest you run post-install script directly and see what is happening
there:

sh -x /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst

Thank you for the suggestion. This is the result:

$ sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst

Stephen,

   This is how I upgrade my Fedora machines. Everything on /home stays intact because I don't reformat it.  I can switch to Ubuntu if I want.  I don't have application data on my root partition.  If I did, I would back it up regularly, and before doing a re-install.  My /etc directory is backed up weekly, automatically.

   I document my install procedure.  I post this on my website to encourage other Linux users, but my original purpose was to be able to it again, later.

I have the same result on my Debian box, when run without parameters.

but this one ends with 'exit 0':
sh -x   /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst configure

(note I run in it debug mode with "sh -x")


If it still have non zero exit from that script and you believe that
your system is fine, you can put
exit 0
in the beginning of that file (after shebang) and run

dpkg --configure -a

to fix unconfigured packages

I tried that and I get

+ return 1
+ exit 1

At the beginning I get:

no talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory

Which I am concerned about.

I'm with the others -- the problem should be fixable. I've dealt with some messy
upgrade problems at times, but I've *never* had to do a clean install. A problem
with one package should be fixable, even if the fix is tricky...

For what it's worth on backups...

- I'm a fan of automysqlbackup (in the Ubuntu and Debian repositories) for MySQL
backups, which is a wrapper script for mysqldump that compresses, rotates, saves
daily/weekly/monthly versions, notifies on error, etc.

- For filesystem backups, rsnapshot is pretty great for incremental, versioned
backups


Other packages I often install on a clean Ubuntu/Debian server:
- logwatch: log analyser
- fail2ban: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
- munin: gathers graphs for performance monitoring

Subject: [GTALUG] Swift vs Go vs Python vs Ruby
Message-ID: <557B1194.1070709@mylesbraithwaite.com>

At this week's GTALUG meeting a couple of people asked what Swift looked
like compared to other languages here is an example of a nursery rhyme:

Swift:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.swift>

Go:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.go>

Python:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.py>

Ruby:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.rb>

I also mistakenly said that Go and Swift look like Python but Go and
Swift look nothing a like. After some more research I should have said
Go and Swift look the same but take a lot of influence from Python and C.

Cool.

A few weeks ago I was reading about it. Well, not about all the 4, but
about a few differences between Go and Swift, and I found an
interesting article about it. If anyone is interested, there´s a good
reading:

I have a rather weird bit of Linux history, a 90 page VA Linux Systems
Stock Prospectus (November 17, 1999): I actually bought into their
initial public offering - I was living in the U.S. at the time.  It's
all risk assessment and financials.  I'm about to chuck it into the
recycling, but it occurred to me that someone might be interested.  Or
perhaps that's a stretch ... but I'll hold onto it for a few days.
Let me know if you want it.

Well Android is kinda Linux based ....

Now that I can walk from my Bell Mobility contract I am looking to 
unlock my phone.

Free tutorials do not work on my current Android OS version. 4.4.2

I see a number of web sites offering unlocking that cost about $50. That 
is what Bell charges.

I went to a computer outlet store and they quoted $35. Not sure if I get 
a guarantee, so Bell at $50 is still a consideration.

Any and all comments and suggestion most welcome!

Hello Stephen,

I would pay Bell the $50 because if they brick it, there is a chance that they will replace the phone.

Read the Terms and Conditions associated with the unlocking and ask them questions first, however.

(Not sure my reply will make it to the GTA list, so feel free to forward
it).

I never had a phone brick when unlocking it, though I did this 5 or 6
times in recent years.

The way it works is that the unlock company gets your IMEI, and they
send you an unlock code. When you insert your SIM and power on the
phone, it asks for an unlock code, and you just enter it, and that is it.

Sony phones (the brand I use most) costs $29.99 US, and they are among
the most costly to unlock. Other phones cost less.

On Cell Unlocker's web site, you can enter the make/model/carrier and
IMEI and they give you a quote, so you know ahead of time how much it
costs.

Hi all,

My BlackBerry is dying.  So, I'm looking to buy a cheap cell phone out
right for Rogers network.  I don't care about locked, unlocked, Android,
Windows, etc, because my usage is 95% text and 5% voice.

Which brand do you recommend?  CanadaComputers has BLU phones (Android).
Microsoft Stores has them too.  Any feedback on these BLU phones?

Any phone unlocked for $9.99 ( can highly recommend they unlocked a
Blackberry and a Samsung for me took less than 10 mins )

HI William,

There are Blu and Que phones.

QUE: http://queproducts.com/
BLU: http://www.bluproducts.com/index.php/android-phones

Both have Dual SIM, both very decent devices. Price is very affordable.

Flip side is you may not ( or you may ) receive the clarity say of a
Samsung or LG and if shit happens I have no idea what their replacement
policy is or warranties are.

My 2cents both are very solid devices for the price.

Thanks - Aruna

Greetings from the GTALUG branch office in Geneva.

I just bought an LG G4 and am EXTREMELY happy with it. Best phone I've ever
owned. But probably beyond your price expectations.

For what you want I would highly suggest looking at the Moto E, which is
normally $180 from Telus, Koodo, and staples. Canada Computers currently
has it on special for $150
<http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=30_415&item_id=082273>.
Many reviews call it one of the best smartphones at the low end.

You might consider the Nexus 5.  If you've been with Rogers for a while,
you may be able to get one for free.  Back in late 2013, just after the
N5 was released, I was able to get one for $100.  At the moment, they're
"free" with some plans.  So, give Rogers a call and tell them you've
been with them for however long you've been with them and tell them you
want to upgrade.  You may wind up with a free phone, without having to
take out a new plan.  However, it would also be a good time to compare
your current plan with whatever they're offering.  They might be able to
offer a cheaper one etc.

I could have got another phone for free, but I wanted the N5 and am
quite happy with it.

Hmm...  That link timed out.  You'll have to go to the Rogers site and
search on Nexus 5.

Has anyone tried the new Asus Zenphone 2?
http://www.canadacomputers.com/asus/zenfone2.php  (also available at other
stores)  It comes unlocked and I think it works with Wind Mobile.  It's
$250.

The Nexus 4 and 5 are also both very good phones (constant OS updates!).

I'm curious what these phones are like...  "Dual SIM" tells me these are
rebranded Chinese phones, though.

You are a quirky case.  Not meant as an insult -- I'm a quirky case
too.  That probably means you should pay attention to why folks are
making recommendations and not what the actual phone model they
recommend.

As I understand it (and I've not been shopping), all phones sold
through Microsoft Stores are running Windows Phone OS.  Including BLU
models.  If you truly don't care about the OS (and things that go with
it), the Microsoft Store often has very good prices.  And they are
always unlocked (a bonus even if you don't care now).  I care about
the OS and Windows Phone would not be my first choice.

Do you care about a physical keyboard?  BB would seem to be the only game 
in town (probably not strictly true).  And with BB's challenged business, 
my impression is that you can find them at a fairly good price.  You 
probably want to try a keyboard before you buy a phone.

I like the idea of a Nexus 5 but it isn't clear that its strengths
match your desires.  I've been happy with my Nexus 4.

I hate the idea of being tied to a contract in return for a cheap handset 
up front.  So much so that I'm probably blind to the rare cases where it 
is a win.

Random relevant things that I noticed.  I have not looked into them:

I am quite happy with my Motorola Moto-G (unlocked), which runs Android. Got it 
for around $280 pre-tax at Canada Computers in Mississauga.

I also prefer avoiding the Evil Empire.  ;-)

If he's been with Rogers for a few years and hasn't got a phone from
them recently, the Nexus 5 might be available for free.

If he's been with Rogers long enough, he might not have to take out a
contract.  When I got my Nexus 5, I continued on with my existing plan. 
The only restriction was I couldn't get another phone for 3 years.

Again, William should be calling Rogers first, to see what's available,
with both phone and plans, before looking elsewhere.  He might be able
to save money, while getting a phone at no charge.

BTW, my Nexus 5, like all Google Nexus phones, is unlocked.

I have an unlocked Bold 9700 doing nothing which I can give you for 
free.  If you're in a hurry and have a similar phone, you might be able 
to backup your phone and restore it onto the 9700, saving you lots of 
hassle.  No warranty or support, I'll just wipe it and make sure it's 
not password protected.

IMHO, you're much better off going to a Nexus something, or even to a 
modern BB10 or iPhone.  This is only worth it if you're short on time 
and don't want to deal with switching over right now.

I recently got a Blackberry Classic.  I think it is great.

Well on the rogers plan I am on, the plan is $20/month cheaper per line
if you bring your own phone, which makes buying an unlocked phone cheaper
than getting it from rogers in my case.  Only some of their plans have
that option, others you are always paying the surcharge of getting
subsidised phones and in the end you are always overpaying for it.

My wife has a nxeus 5.  I have tried using it a few times, and honestly
I hate touch screen keyboards, I have how android tries to be helpful
when you don't want it to, and I hate how inconsistent it is in where
you have to go to do things.  I also hate how slow it is to respond to
the 'click' to take pictures with the camera, once you even find how to
get to the stupid camara app.  This is a large part of why I do NOT have
an android phone myself.

I tried out a few of the blackberrys at a rogers store to see what
tehy were like to work with, and was instantly a lot more impressed
than any android device I have ever dealt with.  It is just so much
more consistent.  And it doesn't try to second guess what you want to do.

I do not appreciate being redirected to the gmail app if I start a
browser and go to gmail.com.  I especially don't appreciate having to
add my account to do a quick email check on an android device, and then
having to figure out that to remove the account again you have to go to
account management, not to where you added the account in the first place.
@#$@#$ morons designed this thing.

Note that I've been stuck with second hand phones since forever, and I
don't really have experience with any of the suggested models.

The Nokia Lumia is well sized, and of reasonable speed and thickness. It
runs Windows~  Also, pretty colours. Why not?

One plus. Android, and generally awesome. You can only obtain it on
Tuesdays I believe. Under three hundred and it's gorgeous as hell.

Of course there are the mainstream ones like the galaxies and notes, and
the Apple. They don't really fit the 'cheap price' part, but I would never
really advise against them.

This is my 3rd BlackBerry.  First was flip phone Pearl, and the hinge
came loose.  Second was Bold 9700, and two of its keys came off.  Third
is Bold 9780, and screen is showing problems and reboot is required
sometimes.  I'll look for some other brand, this time.
