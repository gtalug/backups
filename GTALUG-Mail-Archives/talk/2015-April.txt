Subject: [GTALUG] Postfix / Dovecot Tutorial?

Does anyone have a recommendation for an up-to-date postfix / dovecot
tutorial including SSL/TLS/STARTTLS?

I have turned up a few examples, but it has been a while, and they are
old and my memory is fallible.

Thanks!

William

I used this tutorial recently: 
<http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/> 
(without the EncFS setup). It's pretty good if you also want 
virtual_users using MySQL.

If you want to go the automated route you can use: 
<https://github.com/al3x/sovereign>. It's a bunch of Ansible playbooks 
that setup pretty much everything you would need.
