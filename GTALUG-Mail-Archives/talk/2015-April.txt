If it had a BASIC interpreter, it might have done better. And a power
supply that didn't catch fire ;).

The Datapoint 2200, which was originally intended to use the 8008, had a
BASIC interpreter.  I worked on those back in the mid '70s.  Also, there
was SCELBAL BASIC, from Scelbi Computing, for the 8008 (and later for
the 8080), which might have run on it.

Hey eveyrone!

I'm running Gnome 3.16 in Arch Linux. When I am working, I would like to be
able to shut off desktop notifications, preferably from the command line or
with a keyboard shortcut. I figure there must be a way to do this, but I
can't find a setting in gconf-settings or other likely places.

ANyone have hints?

thaks,

It had a one-line (plasma) display.  APL is definitely the right choice
if you can only see one line of a program at once.

Fairly crucial.

The article doesn't mention minicomputers.  They were in their hayday
when the MCM/70 came out.  Comparing it to mainframes is really
unfortunate.

The MCM/70 was an unbelievable proof-of-concept.  The 8008 was such a
miserable processor that it is astonishing that APL would fit.

The box was not Good Enough for me at the time.  But that doesn't veto
success: neither were the Altair 8080 nor the Apple II were good
enough, but the hunger was great enough that a market was created and
the products quickly evolved.  Too bad the MCM/70 didn't catch such a
wave.

(Altair power supplies were horrible too.  My Altair works because I
stuck an pop-can-sized capacitor from Active Surplus on it with
alligator clips (you can tell that I'm a software guy).)

No copies of York APL are known to exist.  I once had a listing that I
was using as scrap paper.  I couldn't find it by the time I found out
about this problem.

York's Zbigniew Stachniak (mentioned in the article) has a museum at York 
and hosted several interesting talks.  I haven't heard of any recently -- 
I've probably fallen off the mailing list.

Subject: [GTALUG] Ubuntu updates
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1504161446130.25014@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I'm annoyed at ubuntu's GUI Software Updates program.

Context: 14.04 LTS running on Acer Revo using proprietary nVidia drivers.

Normally I use apt-get update and upgrade to apply updates.  Today, right 
after I did that, the GUI thing told me that there were pending updates.  
So I told it to go ahead.

It proceeded to fail.  The Ubuntu crash reporter ground for a while (this 
is a first-generation Atom processor) and then said the bug was known:

<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-331/+bug/1268257>

Look at how long that has been around.  Look at how many people
(systems) are listed as affected.  Look how many duplicates of this
bug are filed.

I don't want to waste the time investigating, but it is suspicious to
me that apt-get had no problem.

I remain quite skeptical of Unbuntu's and Fedora's GUI software
updaters.

I've often said the IMSAI 8080 was a better quality clone of the
Altari.  My IMSAI had a power supply that was almost powerful enough to
use for arc welding.  ;-)

I asked on the #docs IRC channel and Alexandre Franke supplied this answer:

First of all, dconf and gsettings replaced gconf.

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.notifications enable true
(and obviously it's enable false to have them disabled)

Source: the GNOME control center source code.

Fascinating stuff. Thanks for the pointer.

One of the unsung heroes of those early computers were the oscilloscopes
that had to be developed to look at the pulse timing. You see lots of the
early scopes in the photographs.

One of the things mentioned, but not described was the "Williams tube",
which was a type of memory based on  a CRT, with the phosphor decay time
being used for storage.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube

They also mentioned delay lines.  I used to work on some video terminals
that used a delay line, though a coil of wire was used instead of mercury.

Incidentally, I aslo used to work on an ancient "Teleregister" computer,
located in the basement of the old stock exchange building at 234 Bay
St.  It was a single purpose computer, as was common back then, which
was used to transmit stock prices to brokers offices.  It was built with
vacuum tubes & relays and had a memory drum.  I recall gapping the
heads, with a piece of bond paper, between the head and drum.  That
system was older than I was.

The "enable" key no longer seems to be available in
org.gnome.desktop.notifications anymore:

 ~  gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.desktop.notifications
org.gnome.desktop.notifications application-children
['gnome-network-panel', 'dropbox', 'rhythmbox', 'vlc', 'deluge', 'skype',
'guake', 'sylpheed', 'window-58', 'nautilus', 'calibre-gui', 'chromium',
'clipit', 'empathy', 'evolution', 'nemo', 'emacs', 'pidgin', 'nm-applet',
'firefox-developer-edition', 'thunderbird', 'gnome-music']
org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-in-lock-screen true
org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners false

--------------------

so, I tried
?  ~  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners false

that seems to have worked, though I still hear the audio notification.  I
will keep playing around and report back if I find a fully workking
solution.  Can you also point me to the IRC channel you were using? I might
try asking there if I can't understand how to fix this.

Hi Matt,

I asked in the #docs channel on GIMPNet (I'm on the docs team). You
could also try #gnome-shell.

Interesting article about the ZFS filesystem... In the past I have
defaulted to the usual ext(2,3,4) but the ability to make filesystem
snapshots and rollbacks would be useful:

Yeah, looks like a great phone. But they don?t sell it to Brazil. :/

Perhaps after arriving in Canada/Toronto around November. ;]

I've been intensely phone shopping for a little while, and have been as
unimpressed with the company as I have been impressed with the phone.
Despite a really good piece of launch hardware, there are some substantial
flaws in the phone but even more -- and far worse -- with the company.

GTALUGgers (and others) trying to buy the phone in 2015 may have noticed
that OnePlus, without warning or explanation, stopped shipping to Canada,
and only started again last week. The company was not at all forthcoming in
any rationale and offered nothing but cheery weeks-long promises of Real
Soon Now.

After researching on the forums, it appears to me that the company had lied
about the phone's value (declaring them at $99) which eventually got
shipments red-flagged by Canada customs. This, in combination with the
historically miserable service and extra fees of DHL (the only Canadian
shipping option) led to indefinite suspension of Canadian shipping of the
OnePlus. Things re-opened this week, with UPS as the courier and taxes
pre-collected at purchase time.

But that's not the worst of it IMO. The company was caught completely
flat-footed when Cyanogen went commercial, pulled the rug out from OnePlus,
and signed an exclusive deal in India with a competing handset maker. This
has thrown software efforts into a panic as OnePlus now unexpectedly finds
itself having to rush-release its own Android mutation, OxygenOS. So now
the the OnePlus software support, once thought of as super stable, is not.
Those who have lots of time on their hands researching and installing ROMs
should be OK, the mainstream will suffer through this transition as we
witness one more Android fragmentation. Whoever is in charge of OnePlus's
corporate partnerships should be long fired by now, yet no such penance is
in hand.

And then you have a number of production and marketing choices that seem
just insane. The OnePlus is the only phone in its field that claims to be a
"global" phone, yet lacks LTE Band 20 which is critical for Europe. Its
wifi doesn't do 802.11ac. The invite system has longer overstayed its
novelty. And you can't buy one in Australia or Switzerland or Brazil at any
price. Their e-commerce capabilities are weaker than those of hawkers of
dollar gadgets on eBay.

Add to this the fact that the field of
"near-flagship-features-at-midrange-prices" smartphones is about to get
very crowded, and some of the other vendors have the benefit of retail
access (instant availability) and local warranty support. Within the next
month or two, don't consider the OnePlus without also having a look at the
Asus Zenfone 2 with 4GB RAM, the Huawei P8 and the 2nd-generation Moto G.
More intrepid shoppers will find even greater choice from domestic Chinese
vendors such as Xiaomi and LeTV.

So, while I badly need to replace my phone right now, I'm passing on the
OnePlus One. The many poor decisions have me seriously (but maybe I'm the
only one) concerned about the company's long-term stability. Its corporate
management is just AWFUL, glossed over by a thin veneer of social media
cheerleading.

Still they do make well-built phones on low margins. If the OnePlus Two
offers any evidence that the company has learned its lessons I may still
come on-board, while I have a look at the reviews of the Asus and Huawei
phones as they are released. The competition is coming, the bar is rising
and many good options are at hand.

Interesting machine. The choice of APL limited their audience and with 
only a single line display you wouldn't have been able to use it for 
(m)any of the other languages of the day.

I paid HST on the full price of the phone when I got it in January.

Canada Post was another option but I didn't take it because there didn't
seem to be any way of tracking the shipment and I didn't want to take
the chance of the shipment getting "lost" along the way. Even with the
DHL fees, this phone was still great value for money.

This has been a non-issue for me. I don't see any compelling reason for
me to move away from the installed Cyanogen to OxygenOS. The phone does
everything I expect of it and more so I'm blissfully ignorant of what I
might be missing.

Both non-issues for me, though it would be if I travelled to Europe.

This was the reason that kept me from buying one for months until I
finally gave up resisting it and jumped through the hoops to get an
invite. As much as the invite system was touted as "innovative", it
wasn't. It was just an annoyance and added friction to the purchasing
process, neither of which are great things if you want to maximize sales.

Being a WIND Mobile customer has its challenges, the biggest being that
I can't buy any phone and expect it to work on their network. It's very
time-consuming to dig up information on whether a given phone will work
on that network or not, especially for phones from the myriad of
domestic Chinese vendors.

This has been an amazing phone but I don't have much to compare it to. I
let a friend who was interested in it play with it and he was amazed at
how responsive it is. The only concern I have about it is how repairable
it would be in the event of screen breakage or other damage. My son put
his HTC One M7 through the wash in his jeans and took it in to get it
repaired. Three repair shops told him the same thing, "Those phones are
not repairable because of the way they're assembled." I just read that
the M9 received the lowest rating possible for repairability. I'd rather
not treat these as disposable devices, though that seems to be the
direction all smart phones are going. I have no idea how repairable the
OPO is so that is something I will be looking for the next time I buy a
phone.

?You may not have a choice if you want to stay supported. The official ROM
is now Oxygen, eventually Cyanogen support will be dropped and it will
become just another third-party ROM.?

?Not disposable, but not far from. Clearly phones aren't designed to
outlast three year contracts. All the more reason why flagships are lagging
in sales and the hottest part of the market is now the high-value-midrange.
It's a field that the OPO has occupied alone for a long time, but not much
longer.

No problems with three videos from the "latest videos" page. Ubuntu
14.04, Firefox 37.0.1.

If you provide a link to a specific video, I can try it.

Running Arch Linux + Firefox  37.0.2 to watch video at this link:

https://www.thestar.com/life/sourced/2015/04/08/carls-jrs-queen-west-location-has-a-dedicated-milkshake-bar-sourced.html

I needed to temporarily disable the HTTPS-Everywhere plugin... after
restarting and using 'http' links the videos played OK.

Chrome 42.0.2311.90 with no plugins played the videos OK.

It was HTTPS Everyware that caused the problem.  I disabled thestar.com
in it, so I'm past that problem.  That only leaves the videos that won't
play for other reasons.  ;-)

Very strange...  I couldn't get the video to work at
https://www.thestar.com/life/sourced/2015/04/08/carls-jrs-queen-west-location-has-a-dedicated-milkshake-bar-sourced.html
.  I thought maybe it was my adblocking, but disabling that made no
difference.  I wasn't able to see any video until I went to the "http"
(non-secure) version of the page and then it worked.

I'm using Chrome, Ubuntu 14.04, and Adobe Flash.

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC7TUbEW3gyEYQcC8pCK+Mc=QC1Uh5dY_KMPuuYPwxQOYQ@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using VirtualBox a lot recently, and I've been pretty
impressed with it - running more than one simultaneous machine,
setting up an internal network and running ansible between them,
nifty.  Today at work we had an interesting discussion about Digital
Ocean: the suggestion was made (and undoubtedly it's obvious to many
on this list, but it was eye-opening to me, I'm still getting my head
around disposable machines) that if you weren't sure an upgrade to a
droplet would work, just clone it, do the upgrade on the clone and see
how it goes.  Then you can make your decision and destroy the unwanted
version.  All of which made me think "wouldn't it be cool if I could
have a system with an totally stripped Linux with VirtualBox as the
"Window Manager" so I could toggle between two or three running OSes
with graphical interfaces ..."  So:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization_implementations

I've already ruled out OpenVZ as it looks like all virtualized systems
have to use the same kernel.  Xen seems like the optimal method, but I
seem to remember that your processor specifically has to support
virtualization ("lscpu" says, among other things, "Virtualization:
VT-x", so I'm covered?)

Assuming I want the base OS (does that term even apply?) to be Linux,
and I don't like proprietary software, what's the "best choice" if I
want to simultaneously run things like Debian Jessie, TinyCore,
SliTaz, and possibly even Windows 7?

Links to good tutorials and "Getting Started" guides would also be
very much appreciated.

FWIW, I have VirtualBox on my openSUSE 13.1 notebook.  I have installed
VMs for Windows 10, Windows 98 and OS/2 Warp 4.  I can switch among them
and back to Linux.  The VMs run full screen and to look at them, you
wouldn't know you were in a VM.

On my desktop system, I have Windows 7 & 10 in VMs.

I've not tried it yet (it's on my todo list) but you might have a look
at Qubes OS.  May not be exactly what you're looking for but it's the
closest that I can think of (aside from VirtualBox et al).  If it's
possible to run docker (perhaps via subuser)* under Qubes, you might
be able to have your cake and eat it too.

On Solaris, we did tons with very-lightweight VMs, using code for 
security isolation that could create "containers" that looked just like 
machines.

The only limitation was the common OS version, and you could be ahead of 
the evrsion in userspace stuff like shared libraries.  We rarely found 
cases where we wanted a different OS, just some where we wanted to 
emulate an older one.

You may want to check out Proxmox, i use it for the cloud as VM env., it is
amazing!, not sure how it would work
however on strictly a desktop environment. It is free, even though it bugs
you to sign up for support.

It is a neat trick.

But what is it useful for?

Clearly it is great to be able to run different OSes if you need to
run more than one.  For example, to be able to run MS Word when you
mostly want to run Linux.  Or to test on multiple platforms.

In the Libreswan project, we use virtualization to test networking 
software.  Since some of the code is in the OS, we at least sometimes have 
to run different OSes.

But most of virtualization seems to be for other purposes.

Yeah, that (sadly) is a good use case.  But surely a proper package
management system would let you do this too.

- allow more than one version of a package to be installed

- allow more than one instance of the same package, but with different 
  global configuration.  Perhaps global configuration is evil.

- allow package dependencies to contol which versions of each package
  talk to each other.  For example, if A talks to B, under some
  conditions, old A should talk to old B

- make sure that distinct package's configurations don't affect each
  other.  Example: two different packages that use Apache; they should not
  configure Apache in ways that conflict.

- job migration between machines, even while running, seems useful.
  (That's not a package management problem.)

One step more towards virtualization:

Jails are minimal and may be good enough but a lot cheaper than
supporting true virtual x86 machines.

I think that Serious VMware products are stripped Linux systems that
can run VMs without a lot of extras.

I think that Zen Dom0 (host) can be minimal too.

So much of the noise this day is about things like Docker and CoreOS.
A lot feels like branding exercises rather than technology.  I find it
too hard to figure out what they actually are.

I think Red Hat's software collections are supposed to do that:

NixOS addresses quite a few of these. Each version of a package is built
into its own unique prefixed environment, and each build can have its
own env variables set. You're free to switch between versions on your
system as well.

Essentially it is a distro that is built using pointers to individual
packages' git commit ids.

Cheers, Jamon

Replying to myself - that part isn't accurate. The package manager deals
with where the upstream source is found. http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/

Hi all: Just want to remind you of the Toronto Release Party tomorrow
(Thursday) night.  The party has expanded in scope, and we're now
officially celebrating the Ubuntu 15.04 "Vivid Vervet" release, the
Debian 8 "Jessie" release (in anticipation of the actual release on
Saturday the 25th), and some of us are still celebrating Linux Mint
LMDE 2.0 "Betsy", released on 10 April.

Debian "Jessie" release party announcment:
https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyJessie#ReleasePartyJessie.2FCanada.2FToronto.Canada:_Toronto

Come join us at Alio Restaurant at 8:00pm -- Mike is supplying the
coffee and cupcakes!

Of course you trade it for the annoyance of being not compatible with
any standard linux binary.  Everything ahs to be wrapped in environment
settings to find the ld-linux.so and otehr things, because NOTHING is
in the places that they are supposed to be.

So interesting design, but it comes at the expense of total
incompatibility with everything that already exists.  It can be worked
around though.

It seems a little late to retitle this as being about NixOS, although
I'm going to address that.  But since I'm not retitling, first off:
thanks everyone who replied about virtualization, this has been
educational.

As for NixOS - after Jamon's mention of it a couple months ago, I
played with it for a bit and wrote up a rough review at
http://www.gilesorr.com/blog/nixos-review.html

Some points for those who don't bother to follow the link:
- /bin/rm doesn't exist.  "rm" does, and it's on the PATH, but imagine
how many scripts that breaks.
- vi isn't installed by default.  this is a 838MB compressed image
they provided, and they didn't include the POSIX standard browser?
It's available as a package though.
- if a package is installed at the system level, the package manager
will still happily install the same package for an individual user.

Think about this last point: the user will now be using their own
version of the package.  System-wide security updates are totally out
the window.

I see the flexibility NixOS offers, but I think the price is too high.

It is an interesting design that is trying to solve one problem, but
does so by creating a bunch of other ones.  It is not a tradeoff I would
be willing to take.

Certainly the problem it is trying to solve is not one that has ever
really been an issue for me (the few times I have had a reason to use
another version of something, I have installed it in a small chroot
running an appropriate version of the distribution to run that version).

Me too, I think.

Sometimes "systems" get stuck on old versions of Linux (let's forget
other OSes for now).  Why do they get stuck?  I think that they are
working and changing to a new distro release has a significant chance of
destabalizing them.  Maybe the process to actually configure the old
system is lost.

But you don't want everything in your organization stuck at that old
version.

So you end up with a diverse set of versions.  They cannot normally
live on one box.  The cure is virtualization or some other trick.

This all seems wrong, but all too understandable.  (I have a couple of
boxes still running RHL 8.0 from 2002.)

So what are the correct solutions?

- RHEL has something like 10 year stability for each release.  Ubuntu
  has LTS.  This allows you to safely ignore the problem for a decade.
  By which time it is enormous!  But of course they don't force you
  to ignore the problem.

- keeping up with the rat-race of rolling updates is noble but probably
  wasteful.  It is the opposite approach to LTS.

- virtualization allows you to put off the problem for a long long
  time.  But it doesn't address vulnerabilities in no-longer-supported
  distros.

- For me, running a virtual copy of an ancient system let me avoid
  buying a new license when the old machine wasn't worth running any
  longer.

- NixOS would seem to address this.  Is that its justification?

What do real businesses do?  What should they do?

There is an important subset of computing out there that does something
rather interesting with this.

Machine tools run old versions of Windows. I'm not in the field at present
but I know that not too many years ago it was like DOS was still alive and
a small subset of the available control software ran on a Windows system.
Likely things have moved forward somewhat but when I was working on things
the software was at least 15 if not 20 years behind.

Many large businesses are still running on NT 3.51 (IIRC  (the version
numbers)).
When you are at your bank look at the screen - - - its Win XP.

If the software does what you want it to do why change for the newer - - -
big business has always done that.

I'm very much of the opinion what change for changes sake is a waste of
effort.

Now that problem is out of the way, another has turned up.  With many
videos, I am getting an error message: "The video you are trying to
watch is currently unavailable.  Please try again later.  Error
Code:VE_PD_NOTFOUND"

When I search on that error code, it appears it's related to Flash,
which is no longer being updated for Linux.  It also seems to happen on
recent videos, not older ones.  Any ideas, other than viewing those
videos in Windows?

Here is a link to one video that fails:
http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/04/23/killer-sent-photos-of-dead-woman-3-children-to-biological-father-relative-says.html

BTW, this is in Firefox on openSUSE 13.1.

It works in Chromium, at least on one computer.  However, I generally
use Firefox for most of my browsing and Chromium is normally used for
stuff related to my GMail account, such as contacts, calendar etc.

I still have to find out why that link works in Chromium on my notebook,
but not desktop.  Also, aren't web site vedeos supposed to be shifting
to HTML5?  These problems started with recent changes to the Star's web
site.  Prior to that, the biggest problem was videos starting
automatically, when I didn't want them to.  ;-)

Worked for me in Firefox under Ubuntu 14.04.

Note that HTML5 is, well, HTML.

It is not a video format. And there is no single video format supported 
by all browsers. At least when I last worked on this in January.

HTML5 does provide tags so that the server can offer the video in more 
than one format, and the browser can then select the version it supports.

That explains why sites with a huge number of video files are slow to 
move, because the space requirements double, and perhaps millions of 
lines of HTML code have to be updated.

I can imagine the new HTML5 tags are now being used, but the web site 
does not yet have a good process for routinely supporting two video file 
formats.

Older videos on that site still work.  It's only recent ones that fail. 
Perhaps they should be going to HTML5 with the new stuff and leave the
older as is for now.

Also, Youtube is changing to HTML5 and provides a means to make it
default for browsers that don't already favour it.  IIRC, they have more
than a few videos.  ;-)

Just speculating... maybe it has something to do with the particular

Most of us don't try to turn every http url into an https url and many
websites do NOT offer the same content on http and https and hence if
you try you get an error rather than the content you wanted.

If you use something like https everywhere incorrectly by trying to make
it do https for everything, then things don't work.

I can understand a move to https to make it more difficult for spy agencies.

I've found I can get the videos by disabling it for thestar.com and also
Newslook.

The idea behind HTTPS Everywhere is to use HTTPS whenever possible. 
However, some sites, such as thestar.com can cause problems.  So, when
you identify those sites, you can configure HTTPS Everywhere to not try
to use HTTPS on them.

In fact, Google will be ranking searches according to whether the site
supports HTTPS.

Which would then be using it correctly.  Best would be to have a proper
rule added for the site that knows which parts can't be moved to https
and allow the rest to move rather than just disabling it for the site
entirely.  At least that seems to be what the documentation says.

James,

   I am watching a video on the Toronto Star site right now using Google Chrome on Fedora_20.

   Netflix works on Google Chrome.

I was under the impression that Adobe no longer supports Flash on

newer Flash:

Adobe is still providing security updates, but that's all.  Chromium is
just an openSUSE packaged version of Chrome, IIRC, and has that "Pepper"
available too.

My understanding was that Chrome was the binary built by Google and
Chromium was the open-source part of it that anyone could build.

This says that Chromium lacks Chrome's built in flash player:

Well, if you read it on the Internet, it must be true.  ;-)

Here's what's on my openSUSE 13.1 system:

"chromium-pepper-flash - Chromium Flash player plugin

Pepper API based Adobe Flash plugin for Google's Open Source browser
Chromium."

That is a config option in the mailing list.  Go change it if you want
to receive them.

Just go to the subscribe page and put your email in the unsubscribe/edit
settings box, then enter your password, and it will have a lot of options
you can set.

I'm a huge fan of Timbuk2 bags (I have had three in the past). Most of
their bags of TSA compatible (it opens up flat so you don't have to
remove your laptop from your bag when you go through airport
security).

Depends.

What size is your laptop? What are you carrying? What conditions will you be using it in?

Special requirements like:
- Tsa friendly?
- slash-proof?
- backpack?

I was shopping for a bag in the fall, and needed a large bag that could
carry a mountain of stuff, and ended up with an Everki Titan that I
bought at Canada Computers, which I've quite liked.  This one is large,
but Everki has a range.

http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=388_389&item_id=044000

The web site doesn't show a price - I think I paid just under $100 or so.

I had thought to buy online, but I really wanted to see and "test"
in person.

Hope that helps!

John

Backpack or shoulder bag?

I've gone through a number of shoulder bags in the last decade, and
this (I got the mid-sized of three available sizes) is what I still
have, and really like:

http://www.mec.ca/product/5031-194/onsight-saigon-messenger-bag/?f=10&q=onsight%2Bbag

Not "TSA inspection friendly," you'll have to take the laptop out.
Great pocket layout.  MEC has an excellent selection of backpacks and
shoulder bags at good prices, and you can walk in down on King Street.

The Saigon bag is an expensive (~$90) knock-off of the even more
expensive Crumpler bags that all the hipsters were carrying three
years ago.

My laptop is small, but everything else I carry consumes a lot of space.

I have a 13" mac air

Not quite as visually compelling as the video, but pretty deep given
their multi-decade history, is the BCS's Computer Conservation Society
<http://www.computerconservationsociety.org/index.htm>. Unsurprisingly,
it's got a heavy UK focus. It does occasionally dig into Canadian
issues, partly because of the Canadian Ferranti-Packard company's design
for the ICT (later ICL) 1900, arguably the UK's most successful mainframe.

Their journal, /Resurrection/, is very often an interesting read. The
current issue, aside from big iron restoration efforts, covers the
pre-history of the Raspberry Pi: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res69.htm

I'm kind of glad I missed out on the delay-line memory days. I /just
/remember magnetic bubble memory, but only as it was fading out.

cheers,
 Stewart

Years ago, when the Toronto Stock Exchange was at 234 Bay St., they had
a FP 6000.  While I didn't work on it, some of the equipment I worked on
was connected to it.  Incidentallt, the Wikipedia article I linked to
also mentions the Air Canada reservation system.  I worked on a later
incarnation of it, which ran on a Collins 8500C system.

I used to work with core memory in some computers.  That stuff ran about
$1 per byte.  I also worked with delay line memory in video terminals.
