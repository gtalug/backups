Thanks!  You present several good choices.

I see that this time we are only allowed to vote for one.
Last time we were allowed to tick more than one.

I'd prefer to see a way of providing more information.  I'm not sure
what it would look like.  Ranking?  Fractional votes?


More details of the choices:

Restaurant Formerly Known As Love at First Bite (Pizza)
	We know this one.  Not bad at all.

Kaiju (Japanese Curry)
	- we went there once before.  Service a bit overwhelmed
	  but very polite and accomodating.

	- one of several restaurants in the food court.
	  + allows alternate choices while eating together
	  + but most are closed at our time

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka
	Japanese noodle soup chain.
	<http://www.santouka.co.jp/en/menu/index.html>	
	<http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-toronto-2>

Lou Dawg's (BBQ)
	We've been there once (some of us more, I think).
	<http://loudawgs.com/home.html>

The Senator (Diner)
	<http://thesenator.com/>
	Apparently the New York Times reviewed it!
	By the prices, I'd call this a faux diner.
	The cheapest entree (today?) is
	"8 oz Cumbrae’s Naturally Raised Beef Burger - $16"
	(Cumbrae is a very well thought of local butcher)

OPA! of Greece Dundas Street (Greek)
	<http://www.opasouvlaki.ca/home>
	A national chain / franchise.  May well be good.

Banh Mi Boys (Vietnamese)
	<http://www.banhmiboys.com/menu.htm>

	I remember discovering Banh Mi on Spadina, near Dundas.
	Amazing sandwiches for $1 or $1.25.  Well they've gone up
	there to perhaps $2 (I haven't looked since TLUG and Hacklab
	deserted the area.

	These guys do an upmarket version.  Surely worth the money.
	But it makes me wistful for the good old days ("more
	authentic").

Hi Alex,

If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

I currently have T43, and its keyboard is difficult to type on, at least
for me.
    - it's stiff, so you need to "push" rather than "tap", 
    - it doesn't spring back, fast enough or "crispy" enough, so you
      actually notice and become aware of the keypresses.  And, that
      interferes with my typing.

Are you able to type fast and comfortably on your T420?

A long time ago (more than a decade) someone used XEmacs as the basis
of a window manager:

It's been pretty much abandoned for the last seven years.

This is more of a test of the LimeSurvey web application.

There is a way to do ranking questions[1] in LimeSurvey so we can try
that next month.

The nearest to "in practice" that has arrived is the series of tiling
window managers
that have UIs loosely similar to GNU Screen.

I'm thinking of ratpoison, stumpwm, dwm, and such.  The model they take
is that windows correspond (more or less) to Emacs buffers, and one's
attachment of a set of buffers to the display (e.g. - which buffers you've
got visible) correspond to a "workspace" concept.

You set up key bindings to let you adjust window ("buffer") visibility on
screen,
and key bindings to let you switch workspaces (which would lead to
displaying
a different set of buffers/windows).

I'm usually using stumpwm these days, almost always with just one workspace,
so that I see one window at a time, switching when I want to head to another
window ("buffer").

That seems to be where control of this has gone.  There may have been some
code around to enable having Emacs talk directly to stumpwm, not obvious
where it is (and I notice that the repo has moved from Savannah to GitHub,
which probably means I need to "rebase" my use of it; I've apparently been
tracking a dead-ish branch).  Direct Emacs integration has gotten pretty
secondary, it seems.

I think I'd be way more inclined to use stumpwm, and have some Emacs
hooks to talk to it (which isn't hard to have) than to talk directly to X
from
Emacs.

I have a new  T440p with 16GB, running Fedora 22, thus far it's reasonable.
I'm a hunt-and-peck person, so the KB isn't a big consideration: it 
works, I'm happy.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs.  Fewer cores and
  lower clock rates, for a start.  There are exceptions but they are
  outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs.  But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
  do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained.  May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
  (but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
  fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware.  Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take 
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts 
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful 
and expandable (may depend on the generation).  My son's W520 will accept 
up to 32G of RAM, I think.  Lennart has a similar one.  And it comes with 
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older

"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is 
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,
many seem fine / good enough.  None has captured me.

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue).  It is fine, but not
a revelation.  I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches.  I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Considering amount of typing I do, keyboard is very important for me.  I
use Topre Realforce keyboard (capacitive key).  It's the most expensive
keyboard, but my wrists would not have lasted this long without it.

I can accept the hassle of external keyboard with laptop... if the
laptop has 16GB.  On my Slackware machine, my ram usage is 8GB (out of
16GB total).  Firefox-31.8.0esr alone is using 4GB!  That leaves 8GB for
VMs.

I have a rather depressing variety of mechanical keyboards, including
a couple IBM Model Ms.  To clarify my biases, I LOVE the feel of the
IBM Model M keys.  My keyboard at work is a Kinesis Advantage with
their standard Cherry Brown switches.  I think the Advantage's
physical layout is about the best that's available in any keyboard
right now: vertical columns (rather than slanted columns we still
persist in copying from typewriters: not only is it no longer
necessary, it's actually ergonomically bad), dished hand areas to
match differences in finger length, and a split between the hands.

I have three Kinesis Advantages.  As mentioned, one has the original
Cherry Browns.  They're okay.  I have a second that I refitted with
Cherry Blues: that's the one I use at home.  That's my idea of a great
keyboard.  The Cherry Blues are about as close as you'll get to the
behaviour of the IBM Model M buckling spring keys (short of buying one
of the Unicomp keyboards that actually have buckling springs).  They
have a strong tactile click when the key activates.  It's also
audible: it's just as well I live alone, as the Blues are notoriously
loud and irritate the crap out of people nearby (just like the Model
M).  I refitted the third Kinesis Advantage with Cherry Clears.
Initially they feel quite similar to the Browns, but they're stiffer:
you don't notice it immediately, but after a couple hours of typing, I
found it genuinely tiring to use.  I don't use it much.

I highly recommend the Cherry Blues to non-gamers.  Just be prepared
for the noise.  The bigger Canada Computers stores usually have
several keyboards with different Cherry switches out for testing.

If anyone has questions about any of this, feel free to contact me
off-list: I've been a bit of a keyboard wonk for a couple decades.

FWIW I have been very happy with my Cooler Master CheeryBrown-based KB
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=21_273_274&item_id=061959

I brought it to work to replace the crap PC standard one that came with the
office PC. Quieter then Cherry Blue but still noisier than the squishy
standard, works just as good for me.

Based on the statuses (e.g. - autoRenewPeriod), nope, they didn't.
The registry did that automatically.  (There's standard policy about that.
See RFC 3915)

I wouldn't assume that all will necessarily "be well"; the DNS info is
pretty
clear about pointing it to a "parking zone".

The bit of being in autoRenewPeriod means things are a bit on "autopilot,"
and I'd kind of expect that the registrar is trying to pester the owner to
pay them.

If the folk managing the domain have forgotten about it, and email
addresses
have changed, and such, then perhaps the warnings of Deletion Coming
Soon will disappear into the aether.

If anyone knows anyone involved (e.g. - perhaps the Shawn Amundson
indicated in contact information in WHOIS), it's probably worth giving them
a poke soon-ish otherwise the domain may go away.  An email address
of form "something at gimp.org" won't work, for sure, right now.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now. But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs. Fewer cores and
lower clock rates, for a start. There are exceptions but they are
outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs. But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained. May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
(but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware. Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful
and expandable (may depend on the generation). My son's W520 will accept
up to 32G of RAM, I think. Lennart has a similar one. And it comes with
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

- quad core i7-4710hq
- 1920x1080 17" IPS screen
- 16G of RAM (that may well be the limit)
- NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX860M Graphics with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM
Beware: bilingual keyboard

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older
ThinkPads. One of the main complaints about newer ThinkPad keyboards is
"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- keyboards are at least partially a matter of personal taste

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,
many seem fine / good enough. None has captured me.

Many typists like being sure when they press a key.

Significant key travel is considered desirable by many (but not all).

A tactile signal of a keypress registering is considered a Good Thing
(except by many gamers). Something sort of lost with most modern
key structures.

There has been a renaissance of mechanical keyboards. They cost
several times as much as regular keyboards. And a great deal has been

Cherry blue, brown, or clear keys.
<http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/>

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue). It is fine, but not
a revelation. I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches. I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Ouch.  This is an argument in favour of having different parts of services
in some different places, particularly email services.

Interesting tool I saw pointed at in the discussion; it offers the ability
to notify SEVERAL people of impending expiries of domains and SSL certs.

It of course has some clear "and why should I trust this with anything
important?" issues.

Apologies for the infographic: huge, but actually kind of interesting.  And
I know I've said it before, but I've always enjoyed FSOSS: it's a good
conference (and cheap).

Hi William,

I used to have T42 a few years ago, and after years of abuse the
keyboard on that laptop starter to bend and rattle as I typed, that kind
of annoyed me but that was caused due to wear and tear, although your
keyboard has a different defect, I suspect it was caused by the same
reason. At this point your T43 is 10 years old.

Other than that I would consider thinkpad keyboars as good of a laptop
keyboard as it could ever be -- both for layout (function pgup/down keys
in a separate row) and key travel (it is pretty crisp).

Unlike other laptop keyboards, especially cramped netbook keyboards, I'm
able to type comfortably for extended periods of time without getting
any pain in my wrists, keys are big, far apart and I have sausage
fingers. Still it is not as good as separate keyboard, and a good
computer table/chair combo, as laptops by their design, inherently put
you in a suboptimal typing position, but it is as good as it possibly
gets for a laptop.

I tend to be pretty hard on keyboard so on average I tend to replace the
keyboard on my laptop every few years -- there are three variants. So
far I've used two types -- the only difference I've noticed is in the
design of butterfly mechanism supporting the keys. I've been been
completely contend with both.

Replacing a keyboard on a thinkpad is a really easy thing to do,
instructions for replacing most of the things on thinkpads are available
on lenovo website.

If you're planning to use a T420 as a desktop, I highly suggest you
getting a docking station, you can get one really cheap these days, and
it might support dual external screens.
