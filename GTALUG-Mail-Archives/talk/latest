512kb is a very long key :-)

Temporary key?  You mean the key generated by the DH exchange?  The
normal term is "ephemeral".

I don't understand U of T's email systems.  I connect to the Department of 
Computer Science servers sometimes.  I think that they are run by DCS.  
There was a big fight last year or so in which the university outsourced 
email to google (I think; horrible for privacy).  Are you talking to a 
departmental server or a university-wide server?

In any case, they should be easily shamed into upgrading.

I had outbound problems, some very similar to yours

If all else fails, you don't have to actually be a spammer (and
I'm not) but "SendGrid" will punch your ticket for free if you
send less than 400 emails a day. 

They seem able to send anything to anybody with access to the
disposition of the email if you should need it.

Looking at inbound headers  too, I notice a couple of well known
reputable companies using SendGrid.

Yes, I feel it's the same way. Bluetooth was all screwed up under
Utopic, too. I need both, and only under Ubuntu do the two not play
nicely together.

I have an HP Laserjet 1012. It prints 8.5x11 like a dream. Flawlessly
compatible with Ubuntu, connecting directly via USB.

http://www.amazon.com/HP-Q2461A-ABA-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B0000C1XHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435768875&sr=8-1&keywords=laserjet+1012

It's a bit pricey on Amazon, mainly because it is discontinued and still
very popular. The PRO P1102w may be the replacement. It is also a USB
printer:

I have tested the European model, it works perfectly. Not sure if the North
American version will work the same. I guess it should.

DCS runs their own systems for CS students, and occasionally for engineers:
http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/

This is very different and totally separate from the general systems that U of T
runs. About 4 or 5 years back, U of T deprecated their only UTORmail system,
which they ran internally, for "UTMail+", which is Microsoft. They were forcing
people to migrate, first students, then clubs, not sure if/when staff accounts
were forced over.

I use the UTMail+ IMAP/SMTP servers with no problem from Icedove/Thunderbird...
and I've been doing this for a decade, through the transition from UTORmail to
UTMail+... though I've never tried from Postfix.

With UTMail+, my SMTP server is pod51008.outlook.com (or something like that).
With UTORmail, it was smtp.utoronto.ca or something with extra numbers. (I never
used CDF SMTP... I just had my CDF account forward mail to my UTORmail account...)

I guess it would help to know what system (or SMTP server) in particular you're
using?
