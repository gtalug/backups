512kb is a very long key :-)

Temporary key?  You mean the key generated by the DH exchange?  The
normal term is "ephemeral".

I don't understand U of T's email systems.  I connect to the Department of 
Computer Science servers sometimes.  I think that they are run by DCS.  
There was a big fight last year or so in which the university outsourced 
email to google (I think; horrible for privacy).  Are you talking to a 
departmental server or a university-wide server?

In any case, they should be easily shamed into upgrading.

I had outbound problems, some very similar to yours

If all else fails, you don't have to actually be a spammer (and
I'm not) but "SendGrid" will punch your ticket for free if you
send less than 400 emails a day. 

They seem able to send anything to anybody with access to the
disposition of the email if you should need it.

Looking at inbound headers  too, I notice a couple of well known
reputable companies using SendGrid.

Yes, I feel it's the same way. Bluetooth was all screwed up under
Utopic, too. I need both, and only under Ubuntu do the two not play

I have an HP Laserjet 1012. It prints 8.5x11 like a dream. Flawlessly
compatible with Ubuntu, connecting directly via USB.

http://www.amazon.com/HP-Q2461A-ABA-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B0000C1XHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435768875&sr=8-1&keywords=laserjet+1012

It's a bit pricey on Amazon, mainly because it is discontinued and still
very popular. The PRO P1102w may be the replacement. It is also a USB
printer:

http://www.amazon.com/HP-CE657A-BGJ-LaserJet-P1102w/dp/B0036TGGVO/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1435768959&sr=1-5&keywords=hp+laserjet&refinements=p_n_feature_five_browse-bin%3A5662328011

I have tested the European model, it works perfectly. Not sure if the North
American version will work the same. I guess it should.

DCS runs their own systems for CS students, and occasionally for engineers:
http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/

This is very different and totally separate from the general systems that U of T
runs. About 4 or 5 years back, U of T deprecated their only UTORmail system,
which they ran internally, for "UTMail+", which is Microsoft. They were forcing
people to migrate, first students, then clubs, not sure if/when staff accounts
were forced over.

I use the UTMail+ IMAP/SMTP servers with no problem from Icedove/Thunderbird...
and I've been doing this for a decade, through the transition from UTORmail to
UTMail+... though I've never tried from Postfix.

With UTMail+, my SMTP server is pod51008.outlook.com (or something like that).
With UTORmail, it was smtp.utoronto.ca or something with extra numbers. (I never
used CDF SMTP... I just had my CDF account forward mail to my UTORmail account...)

I guess it would help to know what system (or SMTP server) in particular you're
using?

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC4QruLrZe+20vxsmMrSLdfFi8vTi7Yb3664yzeRC-DOfA@mail.gmail.com>

I have this idea that's been slowly forming in my head.  I wanted to
run it by TLUG for opinions to find out if I'm totally crazy or if it
might work.

I hope to set up my desktop (and probably my laptop as well) to have a
Debian stable base OS - about as stripped as I can manage, just X with
a lightweight window manager (probably OpenBox).  On top of that would
be VirtualBox, the idea being to run all my applications from virtual
machines.

Since I'd have multiple machines accessing the same /home/, I'd want
NFS.  That could be run by the host OS, but I was thinking about using
OpenWRT as the NFS server.  But that immediately runs into a
difficulty: it appears that getting the VirtualBox Guest Additions
running in OpenWRT is (very?) difficult, so I'd probably have to use
raw partition access.  The problem with that is that if the partition
is accessed simultaneously by any application on the host OS, you can
munge the partition.

I'm also planning on running another OpenWRT instance: this would be
used for routing, with all the other virtual machines going through it
to access the outside world.  Among other things, that would mean I
only have to administer a firewall in one place.  One idea I'm still
considering is giving full control of the network card to the OpenWRT
instance and making the host OS go through OpenWRT to get to the
outside world ...

This could all probably be done with KVM rather than VirtualBox, but I
prefer VB not only because I'm more familiar with it, but also because
.VDI disc images can vary in size (Qemu's .qcow2 image format are
fixed size) and because VirtualBox handles full screen display of OSes
better (at least once Guest Additions is installed).  I'm happy to
listen to reasons in favour of KVM.

Other virtual machines would include TinyCore, SliTaz, and Debian
Stretch.  The latter would probably be my primary OS.  The thought was
to ssh from the host OS to the guest with X forwarding, and then run a
launcher from the guest on the host so any applications run from the
launcher were from the guest.

Advantages:
- I get to tinker with multiple OSes (something I enjoy)
- if I'm about to go to a dubious website, I can clone a virtual
machine, use it for the dubious visit, then destroy it

Disadvantages that I've thought of so far:
- memory usage
- speed reduction
- hard drive usage for disk images
- complexity
- mounting USB sticks on guests is extremely problematic
- playing sound/video from guests through the host is imperfect
- hard to determine where an application is running from

I'm sure there are many, many other problems with this idea.  Go to
town, that's why I'm here.

So, /home is in VM as well?  I didn't know VirtualBox can boot
OpenWRT... if it can boot Linux ISO, then I guess it should also boot
OpenWRT ISO file.

You can run VirtualBox VM in "Bridged Adapter" network mode.  That will
expose the VMs to the outside.  This means, the VMs will get separate
IPs from external router/modem, just like your host.  VirtualBox has few
other network modes, ie. NAT Network, Internal Network, Host-only
Adapter.

For "bridge" mode, VirtualBox is much easier.  It's one mouse click.
With QEMU, you have to create bridge, attach interface to it, and run VM
with "helper" to attach its network card to it.  It's about 5 extra
command lines.

If you know those command lines, then it's one script.  So, it's even, I
guess.  :-)

Main disadvantage.  2GB for each VMs and host, plus head room.

Yes.  Even with 8-core AMD, it just chokes.  Maybe Intel i7 is better.

I found VirtualBox handles USB much better than QEMU.  But, still, both
are flaky and hangs frequently.

It doesn't address all your proposed scenarios but you might want to check
out LXC containers for generating lightweight virtual machines... I have
just started messing around with it and found these links to be interesting:

Hey top posting from an email that isn't able to post to tlug ... feel
free to forward this link to the list if you like:

https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/

Using docker's volumes feature to bind mount directories and files into
a container allows things like running Xorg, with persistent writes to
shared files. No NFS needed even.

I don't have a permanent fix yet, but the brute-force method of issuing

	sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart

makes the network come back. For a while, at least.

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1507052243240.2272@redclaw.mimosa.com>

This story could be told in order of discovery.  That would be more fun.  
But I'm going to explain it as plainly as possible to make it more useful.

I have a KVM switch (Keyboard Video Mouse) that lets four computers share 
one keyboard, display, and mouse.

Unbeknownst to me, the keyboard started generating a rapid stream of ESC [ 
D (back arrow) sequences.  I'm not sure whether it is all the time or just 
some of the time.

The next time I booted one of the computers, it seemed to fail to find its 
hard drives.  It was more than a decade old, so rather than fixing it, I 
replaced it.  I now think that a continuous stream of backarrow keys 
confused the BIOS (or the RAID card BIOS) when the machine was booting.  
But at that time, it seemed to be a simple case of old hardware wearing 
out.

Another computer had different symptoms, but again showed disk problems.  
When I did disk diagnostics, I was puzzled by the results: no problem.

Eventually, I found the keyboard problem and have thrown the keyboard 
away.  I have no idea how long it had been misbehaving.

Lessons re-learned: 

- symptoms don't always point clearly to the disease.

- conclusions should remain provisional

- it's amazing how long you can overlook a stuck keyboard key

- apparently I really only use the KVM for booting; it would be
  nice if PCs had been designed to be happy headless

Many are.  Check the BIOS (or whatever it's called these days) settings.

In older days (a few generations of PC ago) there used to be a BIOS setting 
where you could tell it to ignore keyboard errors. You would enable that 
feature if you wanted to run the computer without a keyboard. I haven't 
looked to see if such a feature still exists in modern day BIOS but I don't 
see why they would have removed the option unless it will ignore keyboard 
errors automatically.

I have 4 computers here, one with a year old motherboard.  3 of them can
run headless and the other, an old Compaq, I just leave an old keyboard
plugged in, but still access it via KVM.


Like I said, check the settings.

Before I got a PC, I had Sun workstations.  They were willing to talk
via a serial port to a "console" (they could use a display and
keyboard too).  This let you do things like reboot when hung, watch
all the exciting messages during booting, configure the machine, run
hardware diagnostics, etc.

I don't really want to lose those functions.  On PCs, they seem to
require a console (or some quite expensive "management" features).
That's why I use a KVM (and grumble).

I think that the expensive management functions use ethernet
transport.  For security, it ought to be separate from other networks.
I have no experience with them.  Unfortuately, I think that the
protocols are proprietary and different for each brand of computer.

KVMs are either expensive or deficient.  Or both.

- cheap ones only support VGA, a very obsolete standard

- some cheap KVMs don't pass DDC info so the OS cannot determine
  characteristics of the monitor.  This causes a variety of problems
  (some modern Linux distros won't work out of the box with this).

- some better cheap KVMs pass DDC information, but only to the
  computer currently selected.  This works badly after a power failure
  when each computer is rebooting at the same time.

- there are issues (that I don't understand) about keyboard and mouse
  states carrying over on switching.

- I have another KVM that is normally sold for ~$500 that does a lot
  right: support dual-link DVI, does pass DDC to all computers.  I
  paid $100, so that was a great choice.  Even so, it gets a bit
  confused by some mice.

HDMI switches are quite cheap these days.  That would handle the V
part of KVM.  Maybe the clutter of multiple keyboards and mice would
be OK.  HDMI includes an ethernet signal now.  Someone should build a
pair of dongles to ship K and M stuff over that channel.  USB over
ethernet is probably already a thing.

I have a KVM that does HDMI and USB, so video, keyboard, mouse and even
audio are switched.  As I said, the one computer requires a keyboard
plugged in, but all work through the KVM.

Nice!  What is the brand and model of the KVM?

USB doesn't count as a keyboard?  Or is it that the switch doesn't
"fake" the keyboard and mouse for the unselected computers?  In that
case, it would look to the computer as if the mouse and keyboard were
plugged in each time the computer were selected and unplugged each
time it is deselected.

I have a USB KVM switch that switches auxiliary USB but for USB
keyboard and mouse sockets fakes them for the unselected computers.

It appears the KVM doesn't "fake" a keyboard, so I have to plug a real
keyboard into that one computer.  All the rest work fine as is, after
configuring the CMOS so that the computer will boot without a keyboard. 
I haven't noticed any issues with not having a mouse plugged in, but
then a mouse isn't usually critical for using a computer.  Back in the
days before GUIs, we usually didn't even own a mouse.

The massive HP printer/scanner/copier we had in the office a few years
ago was a disaster.  The thing it did best was paper jams.  Dozens of
paper jams every day.

The canon that replaced it has almost never had a paper jam.

Of course those are not models you would use at home, but given they
do postscript and IPP network printing, they work great with linux
(for printing, scanning is a different story).

Well I pretty much never have any reason to scan anything, and they are

Because Firefox kept locking up and various other things were out of date,
I decided to upgrade to the latest version of Linux Mint. The upgrade
seemed to work but resulted in a blank desktop, so I decided a complete
re-install was required.

So I backed up the /home directory to an external USB hard drive,
programmed a USB key with a Mint .iso and booted up into the latest Mint.

That went fine. Then I tried to restore the backup of the home directory,
the computer announced that it couldn't read the file, something about
'bad superblock', which is enough to bring one's heart to a complete and
utter stop. *Fortunately*, bumping against the USB cable got it working,
and I think the problem was a bad connector.

OK, piece of cake from here on, right? Then in the process of moving files
from the backup to my home directory, I forgot that I was in superuser
mode and ~ was shorthand for /root. That made a mess, and in the process
of sorting out that, I moved the /bin directory. So of course, no commands
worked at all. (This reminds me of the scenario where someone executes rm
-rf * in superuser mode and only discovers the mistake when the computer
announces: rm command not found. I know someone who actually did that.
(Not me ;) ). Arrrgh.

So I decided that the simplest route was to re-install.

Then, for some reason, the USB key wouldn't boot. Fortunately, an old
Knoppix CD did boot, establishing that boot from CD was still working. So
I prevailed on my friend Gabriel to burn me an .iso on DVD, and that
worked.

So, to my colleagues in TLUG, I ask: How would you deal with the
re-location of /bin, assuming you didn't want to re-install?

    If you keep /home on a separate partition, you wouldn't have this problem.

PATH=$PATH:/path/to/bin

    Or:

mv /path/to/bin /

Sorry - - - scanning is quite useful for me and I sure would like a
way to make it work connected to my Linux box!

Haven't had much luck so far.

James says that his KVM is
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817145111&cm_re=kvm-4uhm-_-17-145-111-_-Product>
(not currently in stock)

That makes sense

That too makes sense.

If you read the critical reviews on newegg, it looks as if the monitor
doesn't make EDID information about the monitor work for unselected
computers.  This can cause problems.  Perhaps not for old fashioned
text consoles (like BIOS setup screens).

=============

I went googling for interesting KVMs and came up with this:
<http://www.amazon.com/Displayport-Switch-Control-Desktop-Product/dp/B00V5I0QLE>

Amazon describes it as a 12-port DisplayPort KVM!

Unfortunately, the manufacturer says you can connect two PC to it, no
more.

I got tired of hunting for unicorns.  Not only are KVMs that match my
requirements rare and expensive, it is hard to identify them amongst
the descriptions of inferior products.

Here's a useful document from Microsoft:
<http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/E/7/7E7662CF-CBEA-470B-A97E-CE7CE0D98DC2/KVM-Win7.docx>
It deals only with video issues.  Apparently there is/was a "Windows
Logo Program" for KVM switches.  I don't remember ever seeing a
Windows logo on a KVM, but I would take it as a Good Thing.
Oh, it seems that the logo program was retired "with the release of
the Windows Logo Kit (WLK) for Windows Server 2008 RTM."  Darn.
