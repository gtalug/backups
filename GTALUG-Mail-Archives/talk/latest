512kb is a very long key :-)

Temporary key?  You mean the key generated by the DH exchange?  The
normal term is "ephemeral".

I don't understand U of T's email systems.  I connect to the Department of 
Computer Science servers sometimes.  I think that they are run by DCS.  
There was a big fight last year or so in which the university outsourced 
email to google (I think; horrible for privacy).  Are you talking to a 
departmental server or a university-wide server?

In any case, they should be easily shamed into upgrading.

I had outbound problems, some very similar to yours

If all else fails, you don't have to actually be a spammer (and
I'm not) but "SendGrid" will punch your ticket for free if you
send less than 400 emails a day. 

They seem able to send anything to anybody with access to the
disposition of the email if you should need it.

Looking at inbound headers  too, I notice a couple of well known
reputable companies using SendGrid.

Yes, I feel it's the same way. Bluetooth was all screwed up under
Utopic, too. I need both, and only under Ubuntu do the two not play

I have an HP Laserjet 1012. It prints 8.5x11 like a dream. Flawlessly
compatible with Ubuntu, connecting directly via USB.

http://www.amazon.com/HP-Q2461A-ABA-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B0000C1XHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435768875&sr=8-1&keywords=laserjet+1012

It's a bit pricey on Amazon, mainly because it is discontinued and still
very popular. The PRO P1102w may be the replacement. It is also a USB
printer:

http://www.amazon.com/HP-CE657A-BGJ-LaserJet-P1102w/dp/B0036TGGVO/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1435768959&sr=1-5&keywords=hp+laserjet&refinements=p_n_feature_five_browse-bin%3A5662328011

I have tested the European model, it works perfectly. Not sure if the North
American version will work the same. I guess it should.

DCS runs their own systems for CS students, and occasionally for engineers:
http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/

This is very different and totally separate from the general systems that U of T
runs. About 4 or 5 years back, U of T deprecated their only UTORmail system,
which they ran internally, for "UTMail+", which is Microsoft. They were forcing
people to migrate, first students, then clubs, not sure if/when staff accounts
were forced over.

I use the UTMail+ IMAP/SMTP servers with no problem from Icedove/Thunderbird...
and I've been doing this for a decade, through the transition from UTORmail to
UTMail+... though I've never tried from Postfix.

With UTMail+, my SMTP server is pod51008.outlook.com (or something like that).
With UTORmail, it was smtp.utoronto.ca or something with extra numbers. (I never
used CDF SMTP... I just had my CDF account forward mail to my UTORmail account...)

I guess it would help to know what system (or SMTP server) in particular you're
using?

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC4QruLrZe+20vxsmMrSLdfFi8vTi7Yb3664yzeRC-DOfA@mail.gmail.com>

I have this idea that's been slowly forming in my head.  I wanted to
run it by TLUG for opinions to find out if I'm totally crazy or if it
might work.

I hope to set up my desktop (and probably my laptop as well) to have a
Debian stable base OS - about as stripped as I can manage, just X with
a lightweight window manager (probably OpenBox).  On top of that would
be VirtualBox, the idea being to run all my applications from virtual
machines.

Since I'd have multiple machines accessing the same /home/, I'd want
NFS.  That could be run by the host OS, but I was thinking about using
OpenWRT as the NFS server.  But that immediately runs into a
difficulty: it appears that getting the VirtualBox Guest Additions
running in OpenWRT is (very?) difficult, so I'd probably have to use
raw partition access.  The problem with that is that if the partition
is accessed simultaneously by any application on the host OS, you can
munge the partition.

I'm also planning on running another OpenWRT instance: this would be
used for routing, with all the other virtual machines going through it
to access the outside world.  Among other things, that would mean I
only have to administer a firewall in one place.  One idea I'm still
considering is giving full control of the network card to the OpenWRT
instance and making the host OS go through OpenWRT to get to the
outside world ...

This could all probably be done with KVM rather than VirtualBox, but I
prefer VB not only because I'm more familiar with it, but also because
.VDI disc images can vary in size (Qemu's .qcow2 image format are
fixed size) and because VirtualBox handles full screen display of OSes
better (at least once Guest Additions is installed).  I'm happy to
listen to reasons in favour of KVM.

Other virtual machines would include TinyCore, SliTaz, and Debian
Stretch.  The latter would probably be my primary OS.  The thought was
to ssh from the host OS to the guest with X forwarding, and then run a
launcher from the guest on the host so any applications run from the
launcher were from the guest.

Advantages:
- I get to tinker with multiple OSes (something I enjoy)
- if I'm about to go to a dubious website, I can clone a virtual
machine, use it for the dubious visit, then destroy it

Disadvantages that I've thought of so far:
- memory usage
- speed reduction
- hard drive usage for disk images
- complexity
- mounting USB sticks on guests is extremely problematic
- playing sound/video from guests through the host is imperfect
- hard to determine where an application is running from

I'm sure there are many, many other problems with this idea.  Go to
town, that's why I'm here.

So, /home is in VM as well?  I didn't know VirtualBox can boot
OpenWRT... if it can boot Linux ISO, then I guess it should also boot
OpenWRT ISO file.

You can run VirtualBox VM in "Bridged Adapter" network mode.  That will
expose the VMs to the outside.  This means, the VMs will get separate
IPs from external router/modem, just like your host.  VirtualBox has few
other network modes, ie. NAT Network, Internal Network, Host-only
Adapter.

For "bridge" mode, VirtualBox is much easier.  It's one mouse click.
With QEMU, you have to create bridge, attach interface to it, and run VM
with "helper" to attach its network card to it.  It's about 5 extra
command lines.

If you know those command lines, then it's one script.  So, it's even, I
guess.  :-)

Main disadvantage.  2GB for each VMs and host, plus head room.

Yes.  Even with 8-core AMD, it just chokes.  Maybe Intel i7 is better.

I found VirtualBox handles USB much better than QEMU.  But, still, both
are flaky and hangs frequently.

It doesn't address all your proposed scenarios but you might want to check
out LXC containers for generating lightweight virtual machines... I have
just started messing around with it and found these links to be interesting:

Hey top posting from an email that isn't able to post to tlug ... feel
free to forward this link to the list if you like:

https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/

Using docker's volumes feature to bind mount directories and files into
a container allows things like running Xorg, with persistent writes to
shared files. No NFS needed even.

I don't have a permanent fix yet, but the brute-force method of issuing

	sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart

makes the network come back. For a while, at least.

cheers,

Subject: [GTALUG] war story: keyboard failure leads to sustained mayhem
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1507052243240.2272@redclaw.mimosa.com>

This story could be told in order of discovery.  That would be more fun.  
But I'm going to explain it as plainly as possible to make it more useful.

I have a KVM switch (Keyboard Video Mouse) that lets four computers share 
one keyboard, display, and mouse.

Unbeknownst to me, the keyboard started generating a rapid stream of ESC [ 
D (back arrow) sequences.  I'm not sure whether it is all the time or just 
some of the time.

The next time I booted one of the computers, it seemed to fail to find its 
hard drives.  It was more than a decade old, so rather than fixing it, I 
replaced it.  I now think that a continuous stream of backarrow keys 
confused the BIOS (or the RAID card BIOS) when the machine was booting.  
But at that time, it seemed to be a simple case of old hardware wearing 
out.

Another computer had different symptoms, but again showed disk problems.  
When I did disk diagnostics, I was puzzled by the results: no problem.

Eventually, I found the keyboard problem and have thrown the keyboard 
away.  I have no idea how long it had been misbehaving.

Lessons re-learned: 

- symptoms don't always point clearly to the disease.

- conclusions should remain provisional

- it's amazing how long you can overlook a stuck keyboard key

- apparently I really only use the KVM for booting; it would be
  nice if PCs had been designed to be happy headless
