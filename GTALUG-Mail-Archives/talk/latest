# OpenStreetMap with Stewart Russell

OpenStreetMap is more than just a web mapping platform. It's a
comprehensive, community-maintained map/geodatabase of the world that
you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years
ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers,
developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of
using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little
drama, and how it succeeds as a community.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before the meeting a group of GTALUGers will be dining at
It's All Grk (101 Dundas St East).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East).

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Subject: [GTALUG] ICANN's Proposal to Move IANA
Message-ID: <1430930541.24607.2.camel@larva.gordhome.local>

Hi, all:

You probably know that in March 2014, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
announced its intent to “transition its stewardship role of the IANA
Functions and related management”.   This meant that NTIA will no longer
oversee a contract with ICANN to manage IANA.   ICANN will have to do it
itself.

To get this started, NTIA called on ICANN to “coordinate” the drafting
of a proposal to transition this stewardship role to the broader global
multi-stakeholder community.    This meant drafting of a proposal of its
own and inviting other proposals from IETF and the various numbers
registries (ARIN, RIPE and the others) and then coordinating them all
into one proposal to present to NTIA.

ICANN now has a (second) draft of its proposal “ready for comment” (this
request for public comment is fairly standard for ICANN policy
documents).

This one is important enough that we're asking you to look it over and
accept ICANN's invitation to comment.   Comments are going to be
accepted until May 20 – that's short, I know, but there it is.

Now, this is a pretty complex document – it's a kind of complex matter,
involving contract law (in California, where ICANN is registered), the
concerns of a lot of stakeholders outside the US, and the need for ICANN
to be seen to be accountable.

So, here it is.   Send your comments to me at gordon at look.ca and I'll
compile them into a group comment for ICANN.

https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/cwg-stewardship-draft-proposal-without-annexes-22apr15-en.pdf

I'm not sure you want to tackle the proposal with annexes.   It's
painful.

Enjoy

Subject: [GTALUG] Problem Installing Driver for Epson WF-2630
Message-ID: <554EBB29.6020604@rogers.com>

I am running Ubuntu 14.04

I downloaded the *.deb file from the Epson web site:

epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.4.5-1lsb3.2_i386.deb

It starts in the Ubuntu Software Centre, but I get an error message:

"New software can't be installed, because there is a problem with the 
software currently installed. Do you want to repair this problem now?"

I click "Repair".

I am prompted for my password. In a few seconds I return to the Ubuntu 
Software Centre.

I click "Install"

Then a window pops up saying "Package operation failed"

I check the details and I see:

"dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of 
epson-inkjet-printer-escpr:
epson-inkjet-printer-escpr depends on lsb (>= 3.2)."

So I download lsb-printing_4.0-0ubuntu8_i386.deb

I try to install, but the Ubuntu Software Centre prompts me to Remove.

So, at this point I am calling out for HELP!

Thanks in advance

Getting the right LSB package installed can be a pain. If you're not
using paper larger than Letter, the standard CUPS ESC/P-R driver
/should/ drive this printer fairly well.

I've had the larger (size of a small tank, to be honest) WF-7520 for
years, and it's been great. Duplex ADF scanning, SANE support over the
network, scan to SD card (which appears as a samba share on the network)
... it just works.

cheers,
 Stewart

I have confirmed that I have LSB 4.1 installed using the Ubuntu Software 
Centre.

But the install of the Epson driver still asserts a dependency error 
needed >=3.2

I have run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade.

Those will really be handy.  ;-)

I think I still have a 10baseT hub with a coax connector on it. 
However, I haven't noticed any ISA bus computers here for quite a while.

BTW, back in the mid '90s, I worked on a project to convert some
provincial government offices around Queen's Park from 10base2 to
10baseT.  In some cases, it was just a matter of changing the cables to
get the NIC on 10baseT.  Others were a minor config change, but others
had to be replaced.  There were also several HP printers that needed new
NICs.

My first experience with Ethernet was with a DECNET that connected some
VAX 11/780 systems.  That was the old 10base5 network with vampire taps.

you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years
ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers,
developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of
using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little
drama, and how it succeeds as a community.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before the meeting a group of GTALUGers will be dining at
It's All Grk (101 Dundas St East).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East).

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members @

Could you try:

dpkg -l|grep lsb

and post the output.

And are you running 32 or 64bit system?  After all the driver package
you are trying to isntall is 32bit and you might be running a 64bit
system and hence be missing dependancies for that driver.

The main lsb package (not lsb-printing) which seems to be what it depends
depends on lsb-printing, lsb-graphics, lsb-core, and a number of other
packages.

Perhaps just doing 'apt-get install lsb' would solve the problem.

My 486 already has 2 (nice 3com cards too), and Debian no longer supports

This was the problem. Silly.

Using the 64bit driver fixed everything!

Yelp says "Yelpers report this location has closed.".  I tried phoning
and nobody answered.

I propose that we fall back to Love at First Bite.  Unless someone
finds that it is open.

Subject: [GTALUG] Postgres and ident used for authentication
Message-ID: <555495E7.3070107@rogers.com>

While it's been discussed elsewhere*, I just tripped over a decidedly 
odd default in postgresql: it tries to use ident to verify that the role 
I'm logging in to has the same name as my unix user account, simulating 
the "peer" authentication available for unix domain sockets.

I don't see any history for this, but It make me suspicious, just as it 
would if I found someone was using rsh and a .rhosts file in a world 
where we have ssh with keys.

The common recommendation is to use "trust", which is even worse than 
ident.  At least ident comes with a  conspicuous warning that "The 
Identification Protocol is not intended as an authorization or access 
control protocol."

Anyone know the back story?  The FAQ is unhelpful, the bugs list seems 
private, and Google finds lots of bad advice (;-))

Hi all — thanks so much for coming out the other night. Thanks to Scott,
Myles and the cast of 1000_2 s who make GTALUG happen.

Rather than post my presentation, which was kind of light on detail, I
thought I'd post some of the most useful but harder-to-remember links I
brought up:

 1. ‘The Map’ — http://www.openstreetmap.org  . It supports routing now,
    too.
 2. QGIS, an open GIS manager. It's rather good — http://qgis.org/
 3. The OSM Wiki; ridiculously complete documentation:
    https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/
 4. OSM Help Stack Exchange-style question/answer:
    https://help.openstreetmap.org/
 5. All of the OSM stats! — https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats
 6. Toronto map growth animation —
    http://www.geofabrik.de/gallery/history/index.html#toronto
 7. Crowdsourced geocoding (+ lawsuit from Canada Post) —
    http://geocoder.ca/
 8. Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) —
    http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/
 9. Canada’s new Open Government portal — http://open.canada.ca
    related: Toronto Open Data — http://toronto.ca/open
10. CIPPIC Open Licensing Project (CLIP) — http://clipol.org/
11. Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team [HOT] — http://hotosm.org/
12. OpenCycleMap —
    http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/43.6666/-79.3785&layers=C
13. *The rather wonderful /uMap/* — https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/

uMap might be a decent way of mapping out some dinner choices pre GTALUG
meetings.

There's a monthly OSM Meetup, and also #maptime, the web mapping meetup.
Both are linked here: http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Toronto/

Best Wishes, and it was great to meet you all again,

Subject: [GTALUG] "ondemand" CPU governor not recommended for newer Intel
	machines
Message-ID: <20150516024259.GA16909@waltdnes.org>

  I've been putting together scripts that run under bash+ash to control
CPU settings.  I was unhappy with current solutions.  They seemed to be
either out-of-date, and no longer worked, or else pulled in egregiuous
dependancies.  In the course of researching stuff for my scripts, I ran
across a 2-year-old Phoronix article
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTM3NDQ which
referenced a Google+ conversation at
https://plus.google.com/+TheodoreTso/posts/2vEekAsG2QT

  Summary... "ondemand" worked great for notebook CPUs from 10 years ago,
but...

> with modern Intel processors, the ondemand CPU governor is actually
> counterproductive because waking up to decide whether the CPU is idle
> keeps it from entering the deepest sleep states, and so (somewhat
> counterintuitively) the performance governor will actually result
> in the best battery life.

  I don't know if the above also applies to the "conservative" governor.
I put together an interactive script and an automated script.  I was
thinking along the following lines...
* notebook runs at "powersave" by default
* run a wrapper script
* wrapper script kicks up to "performance" setting
* launches the job you want done (kernel compile or whatever)
* drops back down to "powersave" mode after the job is finished

Love at First Bite (Pizza)

Kaiju (Curry)

Hookaido Ramen Santouka

Lou Dawg's (BBQ)

I would also like to suggest that we make Love at First Bite our

I mildly recommend against Lou Dawg's, as it very loud.

Hi all — this might be of interest to a limited number on this list, but
it really impressed me.

You will need:

  * USB MIDI hardware (though you can noodle on the keyboard much less

  * a recent Chrome build (/possibly/ Chromium too; if you can enable
    Web MIDI under chrome://flags, it might work)

Now go here:

If you've got your MIDI set up, you've got a decent-ish emulation of a
Juno 106. In JavaScript. Talking to your MIDI hardware with minimal
latency.

I'm linking this here as my previous experience with MIDI on Linux was
highly dispiriting. If I could even get it to work, there was usually a
¼s or more delay between pressing a key and getting a note. This just
works. I'm impressed.

Subject: [GTALUG] (OFF-TOPIC) Looking for pictures of an XL-87
Message-ID: <55613EEC.206.23CE6765@sciguy.vex.net>

Hi folks:

This is even difficult to Google. I had been looking for some pictures 
(digital, natch) of a computer we referred to as an XL-87 back in university. 
They were old units back then too. I believe they were manufactured by Cybernex 
with the full name "Cybernex XL-87". My first exposure to an operating system 
was through these terminals, with the OS being a variant of UNIX.

But if anyone has photos of such a terminal, could you please email as an 
attachment off-list?
