Does anyone have a recommendation for an up-to-date postfix / dovecot
tutorial including SSL/TLS/STARTTLS?

I have turned up a few examples, but it has been a while, and they are
old and my memory is fallible.

Thanks!

I used this tutorial recently: 
<http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/> 
(without the EncFS setup). It's pretty good if you also want 
virtual_users using MySQL.

If you want to go the automated route you can use: 
<https://github.com/al3x/sovereign>. It's a bunch of Ansible playbooks 
that setup pretty much everything you would need.

Subject: [GTALUG] Booting Jessie from USB
Message-ID: <CAEnxSC6j0p2VisAcdjae24o-78ZrX2iXZVAS2LaUMjXV6eY_-Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have an Acer C720 Chromebook with Bodhi Linux installed.  I wanted
to test Debian Jessie on the machine, so I physically removed the SSD
and plugged in a 32GB USB stick (SanDisk Cruzer Ultra Fit, USB3).  I
installed Jessie on it (on an ext4 partition), and added a 5GB or so
vfat partition on the end.  When I attempt to boot from the USB stick,
GRUB comes up and works fine, but things go sideways after that.  Here
are some of the errors that I've copied ("..." indicates dropped
lines, mostly duplications):

     -----

usb 1-4: string descriptor 0 malformed (err = -61), defaulting to 0x0409
...
usb 2-1: device not accepting address 3, error -62 [repeated several
times with different numbers]
...
xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Command completion event does not match command
...
Gave up waiting for root device.  Common problems:
 - Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
   - Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)
   - Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)
 - Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
ALERT!  /dev/disk/by-uuid/44621e45-2a15-4637-d0b8-282b63c8194b does not exist.
Dropping to a shell!
modprobe: module ehci-orion not found in modules.dep
...
(initramfs)

     -----

I've got another laptop that runs permanently off a USB stick.  Yes, I
know it's a bad idea: the point is, it can be done - and in this
instance it's meant as a temporary measure, a test of Jessie on this
machine.  I've checked the UUID of the partition in another machine,
and it's set correctly.  I tinkered with the GRUB kernel command line
arguments: Debian had inserted a number of "hints" (sorry, haven't
copied this part out) referring to which partition to boot from.  I
think they said "hd1,msdos1" and I changed them all (three?) to
"hd0,msdos1" which caused the boot process to last longer and look
more promising, but it again eventually failed out not being able to
find itself.  The Chromebook has two USB ports, one USB2 and one USB3:
the failure is the same (or very similar) booting from both.

My first reaction has been that something about the USB stick itself
is too new - but Linux mounts it fine and installed to it okay.  The
"ehci-orion" doesn't make much sense: "Orion" seems to be an ARM
chipset, and the Chromebook has an Intel Celeron 2955U in it.

Any help appreciated.

Hi Giles,

Debian Jessie is running 3.16 which doesn't support c720 hardware. If
you want to try out Debian, you either need to install wheezy ( but that
kernel doesn't support touchpad), or install any kernel that is version
3.17 or above.
I suggest you download one from experimental and install it manually --
https://packages.debian.org/experimental/kernel/linux-image-3.19.0-trunk-amd64

I've been running it for a few months on my c720 without any issues.

Alex.

That to me says either the USB key, the USB port, or (pretty unlikely)
the USB driver is broken.

It is certainly failing to start USB properly.

Well xhci is USB3.  Some USB3 controllers (In my experience ASMedia)
are awful and unstable in linux.

Try the USB2 port instead to see what happens then.

Debian's 3.16 kernel has support for the C720 as of mid january.

I find myself increasingly annoyed with youtube (even with html5), and find
relief in using scripts to access its content. Such as:

https://github.com/trizen/youtube-viewer
https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

There are also other applications like:
http://flavio.tordini.org/minitube
http://smplayer.sourceforge.net

youtube-dl is awesome.

I've also been playing around with whitey:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whitey

I can't actually get it to play properly... but the command line search is
pretty cool (though lack of thumbnails sometimes makes that difficult). I'll
typically copy the URLs to youtube-dl to view.

# LessCSS with Myles Braithwaite and a Round Table Q&A Session

*LessCSS*

LessCSS extends the CSS language to make it actually useable by adding
features like variables, mixins, functions, and a bunch of other
techniques that allow you to make your stylesheets more maintainable,
themeable, and extendible.

*Round Table Q&A Session*

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Kaiju
(384 Yonge Street).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members.

I thought it would be relevant to this list. Among the new features --

https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/whats_new_in_systemd,_2015_edition/

Things recently added and being worked on:

* systemd-nspawn -- docker-like containers
* btrfs support
* firewall support based on application id and not port numbers
* moving kernel console into userspace, adding high DPI and proper
Unicode support
* resolving config file path with sysctl --edit / sysctl --cat
* network management with networkd
* auditing has indexing and is included in logging
* support of stateless systems
* resolvd -- vpn support, smart dns with support per-interface cache,
support for LLMNR
* rolling avahi into systemd  is being worked on
* journald remoting -- remote logging with http using pull and push model
* logging stack traces without gdb
* protect system/home/tmp/devices -- setup minimal namespace
environments for services
* timesyncd -- trivial  sntp client with time saving for the devices
with no rtc
* autodiscovery of swap partitions with gptd
* readahead support was dropped
* merge gummiboot into systemd (UEFI secure boot support)

I can see why people complain about featurecreep.
