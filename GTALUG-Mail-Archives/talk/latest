When I last looked at it a year ago there were a few being worked on on the openwrt forums. They should be searchable in the Table of Hardware.

Unfortunately it very very unlikely that any will support the non-standard VDSL2 implementation that Bell deployed in Ontario.

Well, at least you don't have to worry about encryption.  ;-)

BTW, many years ago, I used to overhaul Teletype machines.  Back then, I

Subject: [GTALUG] How can I read html email stored in Maildir format?
Message-ID: <20141101023049.GA19776@waltdnes.org>

  My 7-year-old modem/router is starting to occasionally get flakey, so
I ordered a new one from Teksavvy.  Canada Post sent a tracking update,
and it was unreadable in mutt, not to mention that 90% of the email was
graphics...

-- Mutt: Attachments
  I     1 EM ALERT Form         [text/html, quoted, utf-8, 24K]
  I     2 filename.BMP                [image/bmp, base64, 109K]
  I     3 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     4 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]

  I     7 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 36K]

  I copied the email to a text file, consulted with "Mr. Google", and
found the sed invocation to turn it into something that Firefox could
read.  According to the tracking link, the modem/router has been
accepted at Chatham and is now on route to Richmond Hill.  Since I live
in Vaughan, that means I'll probably have to pick it up at a depot
somewhere.

  Anyhow, back to topic... what apps/programs are capable of *DIRECTLY*
reading HTML mails that are stored in Maildir format?

  A possible compromise... ask if they have any router/modems that allow
you to access a CLI.  Once you have that level of access, you can
probably tweak firewall rules, etc, at will.

[Scott suggests you mean VDSL2.]

I have a VDSL2 modem of a brand and firmware mandated by Bell.  Even 
though they are not my ISP.  The mandate is brutal: neither end of the 
wire actually conforms to the VDSL2 standard, as far as I know.

I don't want to use their router or wireless for a whole host of reasons.  
So I don't.  I use the thing only as a modem and have my own router (and 
separate wireless access point).  My router is actually a discarded 
notebook running CentOS 6.

I've heard a rumour that the Modem/Router/Access-point box makes traffic 
slower if it is only used as a modem.  I've not investigated because 
there's nothing I'm willing do do about it.

And another thing.  I bought a wireless router that apparently runs a 
manufacturer's hacked version of OpenWRT.  But stock OpenWRT won't run 
because there are no open source drivers for the broadcom wireless part.  
How annoying / frustrating / disgusting.

Hmm,

That's a bit annoying, especially as you would feel you supported a bunch of scams.?

What brand is it so that the rest of the group can avoid the mistake?

Hey Scott,

It's actually ADSL2+
The modem is gonna be used for an older 7mbit down/1mbit up line, so I hope
my options aren't as limited.

Then I'd just get an ADSL2+ modem without a built in router and then
use your own preferred router running OpenWRT.

New ADSL2+ Modem/Routers can be had for $20 or less. Just drop them in bridge mode if and enjoy.

I bought this:
A Netgear AC1450 (refurb).
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122615&cm_re=ac1450-_-33-122-615-_-Product&AID=10657534&PID=749547&SID=rfdcb-d725&nm_mc=AFC-C8JunctionCA&cm_mmc=AFC-C8JunctionCA-_-na-_-na-_-na>
Quite inexpensive for the resources.  It was even cheaper a couple of
days ago: an astonishing $59.99 (but I had already made the purchase).

Resources: GigaHz LAN and WAN, dual-core ARM SOC; 256M RAM, 128M NAND Flash, one USB3 and
one USB2 port, wifi: an+ac, 3x3:3.
<https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R6300_v2>

The firmware can be flashed to become another model, the R6300v2:
<http://advancedhomeserver.com/upgrade-a-netgear-ac1450-router-to-ac1750-r6300v2/>
I've done that.

Here's the OpenWRT forum thread on this device
<https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46758>
Message 24 is where I heard that the stock firmware is a version of
OpenWRT.  25 explains why that isn't good enough.  Currently it is
partially supported by OpenWRT.

I'm using it as an access point.  It is not one of my my internet
gateways.

If you search the Table of Hardware, there are plenty of device that 
list ADSL2+ hardware, but spot checks showed hit or miss for Working or 
Not Working.

I really would recommend to just pursue a good OpenWRT router and then 
hang a DSL modem off the WAN port.

Examples of Inexpensive single Ethernet DSL modem/routers.

TP-link TD-8616
http://www.tplink.ca/en/products/details/?model=TD-8616
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_1059_1060&item_id=4887159

I've used a few of these, the tend to do alright. I've had some 
intermittent issues with these on know to be dodgy phone lines, that a 
more expensive modem wouldn't run into.


D-Link DL-520B
http://ca.dlink.com/products/connect/adsl2-ethernet-modem-2/
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_1059_1060&item_id=036727

No personal experience with these, but know a handful of folks that find 
them to work well enough.

Or, like I said, keep it simple and use just an ADSL2+ modem without a
built in router so you don't have to fiddle with setting bridge mode.

I've found TP-Link products to be inexpensive and reliable, such as:

If that is just a modem, as it claims, why does it list this feature:

Does it do slightly-deep packet inspection, peering inside the PPPoE
packets?

There is a local web server to manage the thing.  Perhaps that's why
it has a firewall.

More of a meta comment...

I daresay I haven't had much luck finding devices that run OpenWRT well.

I have run through the hardware support list in parallel with reading stock
lists at
local computer shops, and found, erm, "inadequate overlap."   The last time
I
bought a router, it looked like it *might* support OpenWRT, however that has
remained nascent, so I'm still running DD-WRT.

I'm a bit suspicious that OpenWRT isn't sufficiently supported by "staffing"
(of whatever sort) to keep up with the normal flow of new router hardware
(there's naturally going to be new stuff, as all the vendors need to sell
something new next year).

My impression is that:

- reverse engineering is slower than new gadgets get adopted.
  Broadcom is very bad for open source.  Atheros has been much better
  (at least until it was bought by Qualcomm).

- it appears that support for NAND flash is not mainstreamed in OpenWRT.  
  Yet that seems to be the future direction of hardware.

  (technical sketch: ordinary old flash can be written a word at a
  time, kind of like RAM (but more slowly).  NAND can only be zeroed a
  large block at a time.  And NAND flash is much shorter-lived.  (But
  it is cheaper and more dense.) So you need layer of software to do
  wear-leveling and to create an abstraction that kind of looks like a
  disk.  There are several competing systems to do that.  UBI is one
  that is being adopted for some OpenWRT projects.)

- lots of OpenWRT work is itch-scratching.  It often involves git
  commits but not wiki updates.  So if you care about a device, google
  for it + openwrt.  There are often postings about work in progress,
  sometimes even completed.

- turn it around: buy hardware that is known to be good for OpenWRT.
  Unfortunately, buying stuff that does not support the latest
  standards is a bit discouraging.  The CeroWRT folks (downstream from
  OpenWRT, and very interesting) only support the NetGear WNDR3700v2
  and equivallent -- no support for 802.11ac.

  The TP-Link Archer C7 v2 looks good, cheap, and might be supported.
  Beware: the v1's wireless will never be supported; the C8 is not as
  good, more expensive, and isn't supported (it has the same Broadcom
  chip as is in my Netgear R6300v2).

	<http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500>
	<http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32498-tp-link-archer-c7-v2-reviewed>

So why did I buy the Broadcom-based Netgear R6300v2?

I was bargain hunting and in a hurry.  I read the OpenWRT thread on
the Netgear R6300v2 and didn't read to the end; it looked as if
support had just appeared.  And the raw hardware of the Netgear looked
much better than the TP-Link: 8 times as much flash, lots more ram,
much faster processor, USB3.  I failed to notice that the actual
wireless performance wasn't quite as good.

The final hook was that I was buying a somewhat cheaper model than an
R6300v2 and upgrading it by flashing.  I thought I was getting away
with something.

I had actually started with a Future Shop / Best Buy bargain on the
TP-Link C7 (for a v2, but that wasn't in the specs.) but they ran out
of stock.

The FS/BB blow-out might be a sign that the c7 is being replaced by
the inferior c8.  Get'em while you can.

I was puzzled by that as well. (I don't own this device.) Could be it
was incorrectly copied from the spec's for a combination modem/router.
There's no mention of a firewall feature in the user guide, so it's
either incorrect or something that's not user configurable. Protection
from buffer overflow/DOS attacks perhaps?

I'd /generally/ agree, but like all consumer networking manufacturing,
they'll change the hardware inside to suit their costs and not
necessarily update the name or model number. If you're running ARM or a
non-Intel Linux, that change in chipset ? no matter how small (oh hai
Realtek) ? means the difference between a working network adaptor or a
USB-attached ambient air-warmer.

So saying, I had a computer that worked solidly for many years using the
cheapest TP-Link network card and (ack bleaah) NDISwrapper.

cheers,
 Stewart

I often want the same thing (or mbox files, or ...) and the best I could
come up with was running an IMAP server on localhost (dovecot in my case)
and using thunderbird.

I think I found a few clients that claimed to deal with maildir and/or
mbox (most often the latter if I recall correctly) but was dissatisfied
with them for one reason or another.

Day to day use, I use mutt with a .mailcap file that invokes elinks
on html when necessary, and can toss it to firefox if needed (which
is more complicated when firefox is local and mutt is on a remote
machine), but that often doesn't include the images in the message
display.

Mail used to be so much simpler ...

Hope that helps!

I appear to be invisible to modern electronics as well. The faucets at
work are all motion-activated. Or not, in my case. I have to hold my
hands and wiggle them *just so* in order to get water, but as soon as
I start making washing motions with my hands the water stops. The
paper towel dispensers have also been electronicated, so it's equally
difficult to dry my hands as it is to wash them.

As I mentioned in another post, I've worked with these. The are a full 
router. You never find 'modem only' devices any more. The functionality 
for a router is so damn cheap. But they are also so cheap that you can 
wilfully waste that router functionality.

 From a design perspective you grab System on a Chip, many which come 
with two or more Ethernet devices built in, connect one of them to the 
ADSL chip-set, the other to an external jack and slap it on a board with 
some LEDs. A little software and your done.

I bought one of these this past week. I'd been periodically checking the 
stock at Canada Computers and they finally had a v2 in stock.

I gave it a once over with the stock fireware just to make sure the 
hardware wasn't DOA and then installed OpenWRT.

Here are some of my very first impressions. I only just started 
configuring it. I have only gotten this far.

1) Does it turn on, and flash easily?
2) Can I use the web UI?
3) Do my devices see the wifi and connect?

The answer to all of the above is yes.


OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)

Notes:
The web ui is a startling jump from Attitude Adjustment 12.09. The older 
UI had this sort of 'tab-like' layout. Where now the tabs are menus from 
a single top bar, everything piece of functionality under the same 
headings though. It feels like it's more friendly towards mobile 
devices, and also is shinier.

The front Wireless LEDs do not light up.


OpenWrt Chaos Calmer (Trunk/Dev)

Notes:
The nightly firmware image is minimal! The web UI (luci) is not 
included, use only if you ready telnet/ssh in and use opkg to install 
what you need. Reverted back to Barrier Breaker for the time being.


I'll have more to say on it after I switch to using this as my primary 
wifi solution.

I've finally got around to copying my mail from gmail to my home
machine.  I'm using getmail ( http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/ ,
also in the Ubuntu repos), but it barfs after collecting my 80,000
messages across six hours - and then considers the next run to be
"new" so it doesn't do collect only new mail, it collects it all
again.  And having not spotted that these are the same messages, it
duplicates them and the backup directory is now twice the size it
should be ...  I'm using IMAP, and yes, it's set to only collect new
mail.

So has anyone got getmail fully working with gmail, or does someone
have another recommended way of fetching gmail onto a local machine?
Thanks.

I'm using offlineimap with the 'realdelete no' option so I doesn't
delete the message on the remote server.

offlineimap is really cool because you can call a Python function in
it's config file. So if you didn't wanted to store your password you
could write a Python lookup function to check your Password
Manager[1]. It also allows for name translations so you can work with
Gmail annoying '[Gmail]/...' folders.

[1]: This is an example of one written for the Gnome Keyring:

I considered one of these recently.   It really has no router.

That said, for about $1 more, you can get the 8617 which looks identical, but has a router :-)

I cant recall which I bought.  Works fine so far.

Ah sorry.

I confused the TD-8816 with the TD-8616 you linked.

I've not seen the 8616 in stores.

I would bet a nice dinner that the only significant difference is software.

The closest thing to what I was looking for is TD-W8961ND, but it specs
aren't so great, (only 4MB of flash) and when I initially read installation
instructions for OpenWRT, they seemed somewhat dodgy --
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr841nd

I ended up buying TD-8616 ADSL2+ standalone modem, it's $23.99 plus tax.


It is possible to install OpenWRT on Raspberry Pi there's pretty good
support of RPI -- http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi

I know it's a massive overkill, but in this case I don't really need
network ports, I already own several linux-friendly USB wireless cards that
can be run in Host AP mod, and of course I wanna see if it's gonna work.
I just need dig up a ethernet crossover cable, which I prematurely
relegated to be a thing of the past.

Alex.

Are you sure you need a crossover? Almost all ethernet ports are
auto-sensing these days. The TD-8616's and the Raspberry Pi's both
are.

In a wee bit of a spot :(

Have a git repo with squashed bugs coming back from the dead - and a
conference tomorrow where early adopters are supposed to be trained on
using the software.

The strange thing is that there doesn't seem to be any indication of
corruption or bad merges.  There are a few dangling commits, blobs
and trees but they don't look to be related.

Not having run into this scenario before I'm not quite sure where to
start.  Any pointers or suggestions?

Thanks,

I don't know if git-bisect would help, but I've found it useful to isolate
where a particular change took place. You might find that there's a merge
that was done in the wrong direction (it happens).

Cheers,

Alex

Thanks Alex. So far no luck - everything looks about right (but
obviously isn't) :(

Alas things get even stranger... using one of about a half-dozen
similar issues, running a recursive diff on files from both my dev and
staging environments show they are the same (same with the dataset the
code is working on - they appear to be identical), however the two
environments are not acting (sorting, specifically) the same.

Code, datasets, db servers, OS's & packages are - for all intents and
purposes - the same (dev work takes place inside Vagrant images)

In this particular case, on staging we're seeing a bug that was (and
according to the file system, *is*) fixed and QA'd to death months
ago. On dev it is acting as expected (ie. is fixed).

Some people think the way to check in file changes is to make their
changes, copy their file somewhere, then checkout the current version,
replace it with their version (without merging any other changes of
course), and check it in.  It's a great way to loose changes.

Of course people simply not understanding the merge resolution in git
can also cause things to get lost.

To verify you've got the identical files on dev and staging, you can do
some variation on

  find . -name *.pl | xargs md5sum | sort

and compare the output of that command from the two platforms. Assuming
there's no configuration information in those files that differ between the
environments, that should confirm or deny you have identical installations.

Restarting the web server meant something ten years ago, these days, not so
much.

Apart from that, try to nail down why the bug that's been solved is
reappearing -- what fix was made to solve that (it's documented in your git
commit comments, right?). Maybe go back to basics and add a few logging
lines to confirm that things are working as they should.

Good luck -- debugging is indeed a black art. :)

Check the character set: sort(1) guarantees it sorts bytes. Gnu sort 
sorts characters,
which are not the same thing, and carries the warning:

***  WARNING  ***  The locale specified by the environment affects sort
        order.  Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses 
native
        byte values.

The Eunuchs wanted to sort lines of bytes separated by ASCII newline 
characters, 0x0A, and did.  Gnu extended this to other character sets, 
but silently changed the default.

Linus would not have been impressed (;-))

Any chance it's a C project with missing dependencies in the makefiles?
That's a classic way of checking out the right source code but having
lingering bad binaries.

Clock skew can do it too: if the machine hasn't always had stable time
then "before" and "after" become wonky.

If in doubt, make clean (and verify that doesn't leave anything that
isn't source) and rebuild all.

I don't know about the announcements, but you were in limbo since this was
the first message you sent and you need moderator approval. Its a feature.
All your emails after this should go through without a problem.

As far as I know we have a meeting tomorrow.

GTALUG meetings are at 7:30pm in the George Vari Engineering and
Computer Centre at 245 Church Street, Toronto, Ontario (Map:
http://osm.org/go/ZX6Bt7Di--?m=&way=23447525 )

A bunch of us meet beforehand in the "Love At First Bite" Suhsi Pizza
shop (Map: http://osm.org/go/ZX6B4qUC--?m=&way=23447525 ).

And a bunch of us meet afterwards at the "Imperial PUBlic Library" for
beverages and snacks (Map: http://osm.org/go/ZX6BttAv--?m=&way=23447525 )

There is much overlap between the two bunches.

- --Bob, who doesn't believe that "Sushi Pizza" is actually a thing.

Message-ID: <CAEmORor1EoBrUtiz+ZOxhL0YUCGg-h1yb+DcYZ89LOkUV=US+g@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,

Sorry for the somewhat off topic nature of this note.

My wife's employer, a computer services company in Aurora, ON is looking
for a technician to help support their clients. They need someone with PC
break/fix experience. Their OS needs are primarily Windows -- in particular
Active Directory knowledge and MS Exchange. They would probably look on
Linux experience as a bonus, but Linux is not the main job focus.

If there is any interest in this opportunity, drop me a note directly (not
through the list) and I will provide the contact information where you can
send your resume. Don't send me any resumes or personal information, as I
have no direct connection to the company or the recruitment effort, but am
just facilitating my wife's wish to make this opportunity known to the
widest possible technical audience.

Thanks,

Do-Ming Lum

Hey Bob, when you get a chance could you tar (or put in a Git repo)
your slides so we can archive them on the GTALUG server.

Subject: [GTALUG] Crypto Question: Where do you get your entropy
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1411120055080.6002@redclaw.mimosa.com>

[Scott asked that we post our questions from tonight's meeting]

Where do you get your entropy?

Entropy (real bytes of random numbers, not pseudo-random numbers) is key 
for cryptography.

- when generating keys for public-key cryptosystems (RSA, ECC, ...)

- when generating session keys via a Diffie-Hellman exchange

- challenging the other side in various ways (eg. proving liveness
  or proving possession of a private key)

- probably other cases that I'm not remembering at the moment

In many cases a Cryptographic Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) is
good enough, but not these.  Sometimes a Cryptographic PRNG can be
used to "stretch" entropy: kind of like stretching soup by adding
water or milk.

Adversaries can easily break your cryptosystem if you don't have
sufficient entropy.  It's that bad.

What sources do you use?  /dev/random and /dev/urandom are the Linux
channel for entropy.  There are various sources that can be pooled by
the kernel:

- timing of unpredictable event (e.g. user keystokes, disk seek
  timing, ethernet packet timing, ...).

  The only one I kind of trust is the keystrokes thing, and that
  doesn't work for servers.  Others might be controlled by or
  predictable to foes.

  Keystrokes are not as good as one would like.  For example, USB
  keyboards have keystroke timing quantized by the USB scanning rate.

- Recent Intel CPUs have true RNGs.  (Assuming that they were not
  subverted by the US Government or something else.  Or just plain
  buggy, something that might not be detectable)

- external entropy source.

  - Scott mentioned several.  One DIY example: harvest the americium
    pellet from a smoke detector and place it directly on a camera
    sensor.  This makes a kind of Geiger Counter and Geiger Generator
    (I made that second term up).  Physicists think that radioactive
    emissions are unpredictable (except for chain reactions) and thus
    should be good entropy generators.

  - Chris mentioned a Kickstarter(?) project that has produced what
    they claim is an entropy generator on a USB stick.

On remove VMs (regardless of the the fact that you control the host node
or not), I like to use haveged to generate entropy. This is especially
helpful on Xen PV VMs where I've had issues with openssl blocking on
entropy.

Anyone know why that might be?

Not Kickstartered, from a UK-based company...

http://www.entropykey.co.uk/tech/

"The Entropy Key uses P-N semiconductor junctions reverse biassed with a
high enough voltage to bring them near to, but not beyond, breakdown in
order to generate noise. In other words, it has a pair of devices that are
wired up in such a way that as a high potential is applied across them,
where electrons do not normally flow in this direction and would be
blocked, the high voltage compresses the semiconduction gap sufficiently
that the occasional stray electron will quantum tunnel through the P-N
junction. (This is sometimes referred to as avalanche noise.) When this
happens is unpredictable, and this is what the Entropy Key measures."

Priced at 36 euros in small quantities.

Unfortunately, these are no longer available. If you check their shop, they
say that the wait time is effectively indefinite.

It looks well designed, but it all depends how paranoid you need to be.
Certain ARM Cortex microcontrollers have thermal hardware RNGs built in.
They can pump out a stream of noise at a huge rate.

The Raspberry Pi's SoC has one too. It's not super-fast and closed, so you
decide if it works for you. Most other artisanal solutions (Geiger counter
timing, clock skew on microcontrollers, detuned radios, avalanche noise,
intentionally mis-wired comparators) don't produce the volume of entropy
you need. They're also open to tampering, and most folks don't have the
knowledge to know what to look for in designing such a thing. I certainly
know I don't ...

I haven't checked if you still have to build a custom kernel to get RdRand
support on x86. Given past messes over ssh entropy holes, the lack of
support for RdRand because it might be tainted by the NSA was a pot/kettle
situation.

After 4 years my Lenovo x120e has final succumbed to the rough and tumble I put it through. The screen cracked and is unusable. This leaves me looking for a replacement.

I'm going to constrain this question to Lenovo options. I don't think I can overcome my track-point addiction. 

Anyone purchased Thinkpad hardware in the last while? I know with some of the recent models Lenovo has started messing around with the keyboard design.  What are peoples opinions?

I have a first gen X1 Carbon and love it.  It does have the usual downsides
of most ultrabooks; soldered on ram and non-standard drive, but has been
rock solid.  It has a chiclet style keyboard, trackpoint, 3 physical mouse
buttons, 1400x900 resolution on a 14" screen, on a machine that's basically
the size of a MacBook Air 13".  Linux just works out of the box.

The major issue is that the current generation has the worst keyboard
layout I've ever seen.  The Function keys are now a "smart screen" that
dynamically change to "useful" keys based on what tasks you are doing.
Even worse though is the physical keyboard layout. I'll let the picture
speak for itself:
http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/thinkpad-x1-carbon-keyboard.jpg

I know that the X240 series are still "proper" ThinkPads in that they are
easily serviceable and use standard RAM and drives, but have no personal
experience with them.

Good luck!

I have a W530 and my wife has a T430 and they are both great.

On the [WT][45]40 models however they have apparently ruined the keyboard
and trackpoint completely.  There are no buttons for the trackpoint
anymore, it instead uses the touchpad to emulate buttons which, from
what I have read, people hate.

I do see that the Helix2 has gone back to real buttons again, so hopefully
that means Lenovo listened and will be going back to what people want
on the *50 models again.

I see some posts here:
https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T400-T500-and-newer-T-series/Please-Bring-Back-Physical-Mouse-Buttons/td-p/1471840/page/2
that say service reps at lenovo already said the *50 models will get
the proper buttons returned and the case will be improved again.  I guess
they do listen.  Given the Helix2 already got them back, it seems quite
likely to be true.  But the current models I would not buy.

I had a T510 which was great ( heavy but great) , I liked the keyboard ,
and the graphics card was good enough to play games. Optical drive , good
wireless, limited by power ( only got like 2 hours at best) . Linux support
was also good. Performance was good. I had a dual scren dock , and the
device could drive both via DVI.

Then I lost the 5 key and IT issued me a X240.. Lighter, newer, small
screen, nice and snappy, no optical drive, much better battery life. I feel
cramped on the screen. There are screen options. 1366 X 768 , 1366 X 768
touchscreen, and a larger one 1920 x 1080 all 12.5 inches. I have the
1366X768 non touchscreen and I feel cramped.

I have a dock for this x240.. but the laptop can't drive both screens with
DVI.. One has to be VGA. I dunno if that's a limitation of the particular
dock that I got, or if that's a limitation of the video card, but after
going Digital I can't stand VGA. Too fuzzy.

So the keyboard. I have had some trouble getting my head/hands around this
new keyboard. For one f1 f2 f3 function keys don't "work" out of the box .
They all do their "special purpose" like volume , display changing , mute
etc. I had to tell it : by default when I press the F1 key .. it send an
F1!
Also I can't get "end" to work without also pressing "Fn" . ... Which I now
call the "effin" key if you know what I mean.

Screens can be replaced.  There's a chance that it is worth the
bother.  But a E-350 always seemed weak to me.

I still like my ancient ThinkPad x61t with the high resolution screen
and ancient aspect ratio.  This x60 on Kijiji is $100.  Unlike most
x60's it has a Core 2 Duo CPU.  It won't do videos well since it has a
weak video controller.  Its screen resolution is not high-res: 1024x768:

Here's one with the high-res (1400x1050) screen but only a Core Duo
CPU for $150):

(At the previous IETF, I talked with Linus Nordberg (of TOR, among other 
things).  He uses modified x60s because they are the last model that he 
knows how to replace the BIOS with coreboot -- he wants to have 
confidence in the firmware not being bugged.)

I have an HP Elitebook with a "pointstick".  But it is an old model.  I
don't know if they still have them.  Here's a table of things with
trackpoints but I suspect that it is out of date:

If you are willing to carry around a tank, there's a chance you can
find T[45]30 unused models around.  Other than that, consider buying
used.

(Doesn't seem like a great price to me.)

We all value different things.  Current notebooks have gotten way
better in some areas that I care about: battery life, weight, screen
resolution.  I don't like touchpads, touchscreens, or trackpoints but
some versions are way better than others.

I don't think buying an used laptop is a good idea, because unlike
desktops, specifications is not the only thing you can get in a laptop,
but also how they were used -- after several trips in my bicycle
pannier, my T420 has a couple of cracks on plastic frame near screen,
utterly broken cd-rom and several non-essential plastic parts missing.

I second T430, they can still be found brand new, and even though they
bulky and Lenovo already started messing with the keyboard at the time,
it still was usable for *nix crowd.

Also get a model with t-suffix, as in T430s(lenovo really likes letter
't'), they used to be a few hundred dollars more expensive but they
supposed to be marginally more lightweight and rugged, and more
importantly, on those models instead of useless cd-rom drive you can
install additional 6-cell battery. Sourcing that battery, however is a
bit of a challenge.

If you guys don't mind soldering a lot, there's a hardware RNG here:
http://hackaday.com/2014/10/31/dual-mode-avalanche-and-rf-random-number-generator/

It says it can generate ~350kbits per second of entropy... I don't know if
it's enough for you.

If you have a Pro dock (Which has DVI, DP and VGA), you can only use DVI
_or_ DP on the dock.  The Ultra dock has a second pair of ports which
allow DP _or_ HDMI (but not at the same time), so with that dock you can
do any combo of two DP, DP + HDMI, or DP + DVI.  If you want two DVI you
need a DP to DVI adapter for the second DP port.  With the Pro dock, you
can still do that using a DP to DVI adapter connected to the DP on the
x240 itself, and the second display connected to DP or DVI on the dock.
Essentially the pro dock only has one digital connection from the laptop
to the dock, so only one of the digital ports can be used at a time.
The VGA on the dock is a copy of the one on the laptop and the one on
the laptop does not work when docked.  The DP port is seperate though.

Don't then have an Fn lock option to make it always do that instead?
Often there are bios options on thinkpads to pick the settings you like
(such as swapping control and fn if you prefer the other order).

OK, what option do you like if you don't like those 3?  Please don't
say trackballs, because no one is allowed to like those evil things. :)

Thanks all that answered.

Looks like most of the current generation is a wash with that horrid clickpad. Shame too since the x240 was looking rather like what I wanted.

The x140e, still has the mouse buttons I want. But I'm tired of 1366x768.

The helix gen 2, although not on the Canadian market yet, does show a return to the trackpad and buttons. Great feature set, but the Core M processor leaves more to be desired in raw performance.


It's almost enough to consider a Surface Pro 3 paired with a compact thinkpad usb or Bluetooth track-point  keyboard.

http://shop.lenovo.com/ca/en/itemdetails/0B47189/460/60AC6A0372B14F5BA7B12F1FF88E33C7L

I have the usb version for my desktop at work.

It's a tough time. Thanks again for you feed back.

Mostly touchpads, but there are a lot of differences that matter
between touchpads.

[The following long discussion might only interest me.]

The answer depends on the way I'm using the device.

Oh, and what I think I will do (when selecting a device) doesn't
always match what I actually do.  That's why I've experimented with so
many things.

All trackpointers are the same to me (usable but not great).
Touchscreens are of no use to me with a normal Linux desktop.
Trackpads very wildly in usability.

I like mice best, but the logistics are annoying with laptops.  Still,
if my session is longer than, say, a minute, it is probably worth
deploying.

For web surfing on an Adroid or iOS tablet, I quite like touchscreens.
Except while entering text.  But I've never found that touchscreens on
notebooks useful:

- partly due to the crappy support in Linux desktops

- partly because what I'm doing often involves typing

- partly because horizontally reaching for a touchscreen is very
  tiring ("gorilla arm")

- perhaps because Linux tasks require precision that is beyond
  capacitive digitizers.

I rarely remember that I'm even on a touchscreen when I'm using one
with Linux.  (My main notebook, a Yoga 2 Pro, has a touchscreen.  So
does our kitchen computer.)

Trackpointers are simple in concept but I've not really gotten used to
them because I don't have one on my desktop where I do most of my
typing.  (Or on the typewriter or keypunch where my muscles learned to
type.)  My main notebook for five years (x61t) has one and no
trackpad, but I carried a mouse.  The trackpad should be good for
touch-typists (it's in the home row).  But on my high-resolutions
screens, it takes a long time to move a significant portion of the
screen.  I've always found it a bit, well, creepy that the cursor
often drifts when I let go.

Touchpads on notebooks have a variety of designs with a variety of
good and bad points.

- I hate it when touchpads decide that I'm talking to them when I
  don't think I am.  The cursor will zing off somewhere while I'm
  typing or thinking about typing.  It may be my fault, but it happens
  much more frequently on some systems than others.  There's a simple
  fix some systems have:  ignore touchpad events while the user is
  typing.  I suspect that isn't enough.

- I am annoyed at the way touchpad use seems to require two hands
  sometimes: moving a finger on the surface while clicking or holding
  a button (or two!), perhaps even while holding a modifier key.

- having the left button being the whole pad seems like a step forward
  but on my samples, it is designed as a lever with the fulcrum at the
  top so (a) the pressure varies, and (b) is theoretically infinite at
  the top.

- I like the new gestures that have come in.  But haven't seen a
  manual.  So I'm not really confident that I know them.  The most
  useful seems to be two-finger sliding for scrolling (but there seem
  to be two opposite conventions about the direction).

- the middle mouse button is useful in X and Firefox.  It is rare in
  trackpads (except thinkpads).  Simulating by using left+right click
  isn't as reliable.

- new trackpads seem to have soft buttons.  My fingers cannot "feel"
  where they are.  So I have to look down from the screen.  On the
  other hand, if I put some effort in I could configure a middle
  button, I think.

I don't seem to use a stylus.  My x61t tablet/notebook has a stylus
but cannot sense my fingers.  I thought that would be worth trying,
but it hasn't been useful.  If I were drawing things, it would be
wonderful: precise (unlike capacitive sensing of fingers) and pressure
sensitive.  I am envious of Microsoft OneNote users, but in reality
handwriting is probably too slow.

I accepted a stylus in the Nokia tablets and the Sharp Zaurus.  But
the iPad was a real revelation: a fluid interface and not cramped (10"
vs 4").  But I perform some tasks better on the earlier tablets (ssh).

(I actually do some things in busybox on my Nexus 4, but only because
I haven't bothered figured out how to create a GUI for these tasks.
These same tasks are probably better on my Zaurus but it is usually on
the shelf, uncharged.)

Neither generates entropy.  That's why I described them as channels.  I 
tried to be fairly careful in what I said.

You are right that /dev/random only yields as many bytes as the
kernel estimates there are bytes of entropy in the pool and that
/dev/urandom will give as many bytes as you ask for, even if the
entropy estimate says that there is none remaining.

Entropy is a tricky topic.  Maybe this talk next Monday will be
enlightening:
<http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/scientific/fieldsmedalsym/14-15/Images/fms_po_final.pdf>
I'm thinking of going.

Good point: virtual servers are even worse off than real servers.

  To disable the touchpad on a Thinkpad, try {Fn}{ScrlLk} i.e. hold down
the {Fn} key and tap the {ScrlLk} key once.  This is a "toggle" setting.
Doing it again re-enables the mousepad.  There are more hardware key
settings that are OS-independant.  My Google-searching has found...

{Fn}{PgUp} Turn the ThinkLight? on or off.
{Fn}{Home} The computer display becomes brighter.
{Fn}{End} The computer display becomes dimmer.
{Fn}{Spacebar} Enable the FullScreen Magnifier function.
{Fn}{PrtSc} Has the same function as the SysRq key.
{Fn}{ScrLk} Enable or disable the numeric keypad.
{Fn}{Pause} Has the same function as the Break key.

  They may not work on all Thinkpad models.

While a mouse is best, I much prefer a TrackPoint to a TouchPad.  In
fact I wish I could disable the TouchPad in the BIOS.  I first endured
one of those years ago on a Toshiba computer running Windows 95 and have
hated them ever since.

So, when I'm looking for a notebook, if there's no trackpoint, no sale.

  Back in 2007, I bought a new T60 for ~$1800.  Four years later, I
decided to buy another T60 ($400 used) as a spare instead of any of 
their latest offerings, all of which sported the trendy wide-screen 
aspect ratio which I dislike.  It appears to me that laptop manufacturers
seem to think that everyone prioritizes the watching of videos.  Since
then, I've needed to replace the screen on one of them and a motherboard
on the other.  There are a few repair shops around town that focus
on this market.  How long parts will remain available is yet to be seen.

  Both of my T60s are at 1400x1050.  There are 1600x1200 screens out
there, but they are rare.  

  Considering today's ratio of high-end laptop prices to the average IT
salary, I wonder if there might be enough latent world-wide demand for 
an upgraded Lenovo "Classic" to make it feasible.  Maybe it could happen
if enough people were to band together to have some "reverse marketing"
clout.

  I'd love it if I could have 16GB of RAM, an onboard SSD as well as a
HDD, keep the DVD drive, get rid of the PCMCIA slot and modem and give
me an HDMI port along with the VGA.  Give me a 2048x1536 (or even 
2800x2100) matte screen in a rugged 15" form factor with the traditional
hardware UI and indicator lights.  Add bluetooth and IR ports and hide a
9 pin parallel port on the back for people who want to do really low 
latency stuff.  Keep it as thick and heavy as required to provide this
functionality.  I don't care about touch screen or trendy ultra-
slimness or having to be cloud-dependent.  Make sure that it runs well
(addressing ACPI, UEFI/BIOS, and video issues especially) with Linux as 
well as Microsoft Windows. 

  One feature that I would like to be possible with this laptop is to
be able to use it with active shutter 3D glasses for stereoscopic
viewing of images such as landforms, simulated molecules, ...  The
hardware needs only to be capable of producing a correctly timed
strobe signal over a suitable interface.

I have used a few and they are not at all the same.  The Dell I
have a work is terribly inaccurate, and the touchpad constantly is
triggered while typing (so I turn it off entirely).  My thinkpad at
home the trackpoint is very nice to work with, and the touchpad never
has accidental triggering (probably due to both better drivers, and I
suspect being places slightly further away from the keyboard.  I find
the Dell has a terrible keyboard, trackpoint and touchpad.

That makes sense.  If I am playing games, I do tend to connect an
external mouse.

I used to think they were useless, but at least on my W530 it works very
well.  It takes less than 1/4 second to go across a 1920x1080 display.

I certainly like having all 3 buttons.

At least thinkpads will be going back to real buttons next generation

If you are drawing diagrams and such at the same time, then it does seem
useful, but they seem to have mostly died out again.

I find putty on my nokia with a real keyboard ssh'd to a real system is
a handy way to do things.

That's Fn + Space on mine.

That toggles the keyboard backlight and thinkpad light on my W530 (and my wife's T430).

I thought PrtSc was the SysRq key.  At least linux agrees with me.
Fn appears to have nothing to do with it.

I don't have a scroll lock key anywhere.

I don't have a pause key

That's for sure.

I also have Fn + F7 is toggle external display on/off, Fn + F6 is
comminucation settings (sebcam and microphone and such all in a pop up
window if running windows)m Fn + F10, F11 and F12 are multimedia keys
(prev track, play/pause, next track respectively).  Fn + F5 toggles
radios on/off, Fn + F4 is sleep/suspend, and Fn + F3 is lock.

Checking the manual I see I have these too:
Fn + B = Break
Fn + P = Pause
Fn + S = SysRq
Fn + K = Scroll Lock

Do actually try the clickpad.  I've got one on my Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro
and it isn't clearly terrible.  For your use, it would depend on
whether you could turn off the touchpad functions while keeping the
button functionality (I don't know whether you can).

There's a fair bit of Synaptic touchpad hacking going on.  I have been
meaning to read up on it since there's a lot of room for improvement.
This might be a place to start:
<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics>

| The x140e, still has the mouse buttons I want. But I'm tired of 1366x768.

Agreed.  I really like my 3200x1800 resolution in 1 13.3" screen.
That's overkill for cramming text on the screen, but the text is nicer
for that.  1920x1080 is probably enough from the text-cramming
standpoint.

For working, I like a physically bigger notebook.  For carrying, I
like a smaller one.  1366x768 seems nice on a 10", for example.  Only
you can make that trade-off.

| The helix gen 2, although not on the Canadian market yet, does show a 
| return to the trackpad and buttons. Great feature set, but the Core M 
| processor leaves more to be desired in raw performance.

It depends on what you do.  I always feel better knowing I have a lot
of power, but I don't think that I've actually needed much.  Old Atoms
were noticeably weak, but usable.  The Brazos chips like you
currently have are actually OK, not great -- they fixed the horrible
video performance of the Intel chips.  But all current Intel chips
based on Haswell seem good enough, even the Celerons.

Haswell beats earlier processors due to power management and
efficiency.  It has taken a great discount to coerce me to buy older
chips (my T530 has an earlier chip).

Core M is *probably* better still.  I don't yet know enough.  I really
like battery life and I think that it wins there without giving up
performance.

Datapoint: I can leave my Haswell-based Yoga 2 Pro sleeping for a week
without totally draining the battery (probably longer).  My
Ivy-bridge-based T530 lasts about a day.  That really changes how I
think about and use these machines.

One thought is a cheap throw-away notebook as a placeholder until
something good comes along.

The Atom Bay Trail based notebooks might be OK.  But that collection
of notebooks is rather odd.  Some are minimal and will only run
Windows well (firmware only supports 32-bit UEFI and no main stream
Linux distro supports UEFI32).  I find this deal intriguing:
<http://forums.redflagdeals.com/microsoft-store-asus-x205-11-bay-trail-12-hr-battery-laptop-179-a-1594669/>
The battery life is great.  I've not tried Fedlet (a Fedora port to
the Asus Transformer T100 which is also 32-bit UEFI) but it might
work.

In the US, the Acer Aspire E11 is like the Asus x205 but better: 1G
ethernet, USB 3, $200.  Not available in Canada.

This generation of dirt-cheap Windows notebooks use eMMC SSDs: small,
slow, and soldered in.  The M.2 SSDs used in the Acer C720 Chromebook
we have is much better: faster and replaceable (but smaller still).
And the C720 has a Haswell-based Celeron.  I discovered yesterday that
it can even drive my UHD TV set (3840 x 2160 @ 30Hz).

| It's almost enough to consider a Surface Pro 3 paired with a compact 
| thinkpad usb or Bluetooth track-point keyboard.

There are great tablets.  For example, my aging Nexus 10 has an awesome
screen (10" 2560x1200).  I just haven't found something that adds a
keyboard as well as the conventional laptop clamshell.  The Surface's
Kickstand seems quite inferior.

The Surface Pro 3 looks good for what it does (Windows tablet +
secondary keyboard).  It's not what I want and its tabletty strengths
are lost when running Linux.

The Yoga 2 Pro seems pretty good to me.  Better than the Surface 3.
Sometimes there are really good deals on the Yoga 2 Pro since it is
being replaced by the Yoga 3 Pro (Core M).

There are a lot of other choices that seem better than the Surface 3
Pro.

| It's a tough time. Thanks again for you feed back.

Good luck and have fun!

Second the C720 Chromebook as a cheap and cheerful Linux laptop. I replaced
Chrome OS with Lubuntu 14.04. My install notes (with Synaptic config):

http://www.circuidipity.com/c720-lubuntubook.html

Bit hard to find on sale (at a reasonable price) in Canada... though Newegg
and Tigerdirect had some refurbished units on sale a few weeks back for
$170CDN.

I was going to second the C720 comment, but I'm reduced to third
because Daniel beat me to it.  I have the same Chromebook he does (I
think mine has a bigger SSD than his, but they're otherwise
identical), and its been lovely.

My experience with the Atoms has been that my 2010 Atom-based netbook
makes my 2005 Pentium-M laptop look like an absolute speed demon.  I
really, really don't like the Atom.

Thanks!  I'm about to embark on this.

Can I install with developer mode and then, when I'm happy, THEN do the 
write protect screw thing?  Or would that require installing a second 
time?

Right.  I bought ours from this sale at TD, with a $20 off coupon to
boot.  Driven by the bargain!

Otherwise, the C720 is getting a little long in the tooth.  There is
probably a better choice at regular prices.

The bigger SSD sounds good.  I imagine 16G is a bit tight.  A 64G m.2
SSD seems to be $75 so I'm intending to try to do without.

I don't know if I believe these benchmarks, but here goes.
Notice how the original Atoms were way slower than current ones.
Also, the video controllers are now OK and supported by Linux.

Removing the write protect screw erases the SSD... so a second install
would be required. That is the way I did it myself: experimented with
developer mode the first time, then when I was satisfied I removed the
screw and installed a second time.

Well my laptop covers _most_ of those things.

I have 1920x1080 screen (yes it is wide screen, but at least the vertical
resolution is good) and it is matte.  You are not going to ever get
4x3 aspect ever again as far as I can tell.

I have 24GB ram (max is 32GB).  I have a DVD drive.  I have a 16GB SSD
as well as the harddisk.  Also fingerprint scanner and display color
calibration.

Bluetooth of course, but no IR (who ever would want that crap anymore?
So unreliable, and besides I imagine a USB IR gismo exists for cheap).

I have VGA and displayport outputs (for which cheap adapters to DVI and
HDMI exist).  I have proper LEDs for disk and network and such.

You don't get parallel ports in 9 pin.  They are 25 pin, and besides USB
to parallel adapters are cheap if you really need that.

The built in screen can't do 3D, but an external displayport connected
screen can use nvidia's 3D stuff (or a dual link DVI if you use an active
adapter which is not that cheap).

Linux runs quite well, although there are a few features that I haven't
bothered to figure out how to get working with linux yet.

ACPI and UEFI seem to be done right.  Linux is able to use the optimus
intel to nvidia and back switching of graphics.

PCMCIA and modem?  No, but you do get expresscard and SD.

So in this case, that's a thinkpad W530.  Unfortunately the W540 is not
the same at all.  Hopefully the W550 will restore sanity, and perhaps
even offer screens better than Full HD.

Not sure how interested you are in older hardware, but I too got a couple
ThinkPads in 2007 -- a T61, and my mom got an X60 which I took over a few years
back (and am typing on now).

These are my primary laptops still, though I replaced the X60 with a SSD and can
barely tolerate my T61 HDD anymore (I'm trying to figure out whether I can
figure a few broken keys on the T61, and if so, I'll get a SSD for it too).


I mention the X60 though because (a) it's an awesome little machine, and (b)
there are refurbished X60 machines for sale that come pre-flashed with LibreBoot
and pre-installed with Trisquel from this store that ships to Canada:
http://shop.gluglug.org.uk/product/ibm-lenovo-thinkpad-x60-coreboot/

Though, it looks like they're out of stock right now... not sure if they're
doing it anymore?


I started to look into the ThinkPad T430 a year and a half ago, but decided to
upgrade my old ThinkPads instead.

Apparently there is no option in the bios for it, but on the other hand
lenovo claims that with the latest bios it remembers the Fn lock (Fn+ESC)
across reboots and suspend, so you should almost never need to toggle
it if you simply set it once.

Yes I read complaints about that.  Apparently the Fn lock does NOT
cover that.  Very stupid keyboard design.

Scott, my x120e started to overheat about a year ago (3.5 years old).
I went to Canada Computers to try the keyboard on something new in the
$500 range (E series?) and walked out with a floor model 2010 SL410
for $200. I replaced the 2G RAM with the maximum 8 and the only thing
it lacks is the newer keyboard. It doesn't see much strenuous activity
other than running virtual machines in Boxes (my 2005 G41 doesn't have
hardware virtualization, and also overheats) and occasionally building
the GNOME stack, and it's been terrific.

Yes, a friend of mine (on this list) and myself both ran into that. It's 
apparently a known issue where the thermal compound they used dried out 
over time. We both ended up redoing the paste.

The thing that is eating me about this, the 5th gen of core processors 
are looking to bring major improvements for laptops. I was hoping to put 
off a new laptop 6-12 months for those to roll out. Buy then, and ride 
that hardware for another 4 years.

Ultimately I've decided to order an x140e. It's not expensive, it uses 
the same chargers, fits in the same bag I own, I'm getting mildly 
upgraded specs across the board with the exception of screen res. It's 
not a step backwards. And it will have re-sale value in 6-12 months if 
what I do want comes to market.

Subject: [GTALUG] Virtual Machines Under Android?
Message-ID: <5468DE75.5090801@ss.org>

First some background, then a question.

Recently, due to my laptop becoming non-usable for mobile work, I've 
been taking much more advantage of my Android phone. Paired with a usb 
Lenovo compact thinkpad keyboard w/ track-point, and it's surprisingly 
very usable, the track point giving me a mouse courser and keyboard on a 
single USB-OTG connection.

What I have found is that while you can almost use it as a desktop, it's 
clearly not, and you won't get the same efficiency of use. But it's led 
me thinking that this device is in many respects more powerful then my 
sub-notebook laptop (less the RAM).

So the question. What have people done to run virtual machines on their 
Android phones?

A few years ago I had tried out Limbo PC, which was a QEMU port to run 
x86 machines on your phone. You loose a lot of performance in the 
instruction set translation. I know the major Distro's have very robust 
ARM package sets at this point, so I'd look at running a native Linux in 
visualization.

http://linuxonandroid.org/

This comes up in searches, but on the surface looks like their using a 
chroot method. Hmm... which I hadn't considered.

Thanks, Scott. Good to know.

Last fall I was excitedly awaiting the Haswell laptop improvements,
but as it turned out $200 was just as good as $800.

Nice, I'll take a look.

This was sent to the old list but got to me!  I thought that the old

Ted has now subscribed to the new list and posted this but it awaits

This is an astounding deal for a good 27" 2560x1440 monitor.  I've ordered 
one.  $307.61 including taxes, EHF, shipping.

It might be a pricing error.

My desktop has been up for a week.
I have a lot of firefox windows and many more tabs open.
FF was getting sluggish.

It has taken 4k minutes of CPU.  Not seconds.  So that is about 10 hours 
of CPU per day.

What kind of plugins do you have?

How many tabs and windows?

My desktop has been up for a week.
I have a lot of firefox windows and many more tabs open.
FF was getting sluggish.

It has taken 4k minutes of CPU.  Not seconds.  So that is about 10 hours 
of CPU per day.

Even quiting is taking a long time.  About 10 minutes so far.  At 99% of 
the CPU.  Yuck.  Maybe I'll kill it.

It is taking 8G of virtual memory and 4.5 G resident (according to top).

Once or twice a week I shut down Firefox, and reopen it. As it saves all
the open tabs, it drives down both CPU and memory usage, without losing my
tabs.

I've taken to having both a "full" laptop and a netbook (W530 and x120e, 
currently). I find having the small laptop to be super convenient. It's 
what I take of vacations, road trips and so on when I don't need the 
power of the main laptop.

750$ monitor for 250$ ! pricing error? you tell me!

    Mine has been up for 3 weeks. I have one window with typically 10
    to 20 tabs open. It has used 1102 minutes.

    It's not sluggish.

3 year warranty, great reviews, display port... I can't help but think 
that something is wrong, but I can't see it.

I ordered 3.

Thanks for the lead!

After an hour of waiting for "quit" to finish, I gave up and killed
it.

| What kind of plugins do you have?

Nothing much.  No flash, for example.

The scariest is IcedTea (Java).  I don't know how to tell if Java is 
actually being run.

The real culprit is likely javascript -- not a plugin.

| How many tabs and windows?

Lots.  28 windows.  It isn't convenient to count the tabs (I'd have to 
visit each of the windows and count the tabs).

Kong quits development:
<http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=269247&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0>
subject: Ceasing Development
As best I can make out, he did some/most/all of the ARM side of things 
(eg. for the recent Netgear wireless router).

Much wailing and gnashing of teeth ensued, as well it might.

Then it turned into a pile-on-colinsnj.  Apparently he seems to want
the GPL to be respected, and that others think that that is what drove
Kong away.  I kind of feel that colinsnj is right, but then that's why
I'm not a dd-wrt user.

Then Kong posts that it was all a joke and that he smoked out the evil 
Colinsnj
<http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=269359>
subject:  !!! ~~~ YOU HAVE BEEN PRANKED ~~~ !!!

One amusing part of the last bit: Kong wants others to do more of the
work building "optware packages".  To enable that:

    I instructed basmaf to prepare an openwrt build environment in
    order to build packages that are fully compatible with dd-wrt. The
    same is needed for arm and musl now. It is a bit more difficult in
    this case as a lot of packages need some work in order to compile
    with musl, so you should have some coding experience:-)

This certainly reinforces the belief that DD-WRT folks don't want any
but insiders to be able to build dd-ware.

Some of the users seem to be suffering Stockholm Syndrome.  They don't
realize that they would not be so beholden to Brainslayer and Kong if
this was really open source.  Of course they would not have a good
Broadcom driver either.

Dell monitors, going well back into the CRT days, are basically 
rebranded models from someone else. HP uses the same panels as these 
ones, and seem to be well reviewed.

Besides, I plan to cover the logo. ;)

I'd wait until we see them actually ship before you do to much planning for
them :)
My money is still on them sending me a "pricing error, cancel" notice. Only
way that price is going to be
right is if they have tonnes of them and Dell is about to release new stuff
and new prices, and WalMart has to move them
super fast.

I just loaded the site, and though the $249 price is available on the
monitor listing, the actual product detail page has no order button for me.

Try it again.  There should be a green rectangle with "Add to cart"
below the price.  It works for me -- I just checked.

One reason I restarted Firefox (see other mail) was because that page
didn't render identically every time.  I currently suspect the server.

Walmart sometimes has very good clearance prices online. But I don't
think that the monitor is on clearance.  This HDMI cable is:
<http://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/sony-dlchj30-hdmi-cable/6000074943812>
Quite the bargain at $55.  No wait, that's a terrible price.

28 windows, each with multiple tabs?  That might be a problem ...  I
find Chrom{e|ium} is better at handling the tabs and Javascript, but I
still prefer Firefox for the plugins.

As for Java - I'd suggest removing the plugin.  Java in the browser is
a memory hog and a security risk, and if a page "needs" it you'll see
a broken plugin sign - so you'll notice the lack.  But I suspect if
it's used anywhere, you'll find it's ads (on older sites).

I'd imagine that it should be conceivable to run Docker, and that THAT
would be a preferable approach, involving running ARM code as opposed to
x86 code (because emulation would be hyperexpensive).

There certainly is a port of Docker to RPi  <
https://resin.io/blog/release-docker-0-7-2-for-arm/>, which points towards
it being plausible to use Docker on various Linux distributions that run on
RPi.  It's an interesting question whether or not that's much use for more
mobile devices, e.g. - whether or not they're running similar enough
instruction sets.

I wouldn't expect the other virtualization approaches to work out terribly
well; they tend to be hungry for memory and storage space, which are
exactly the things you don't have plenty of on phones/tablets.  (Leave
aside the thought that some of the virtualization systems require hardware
support that's unlikely to be present on ARM.)

Here's a bit of description on what's good/bad about Docker on Raspberry
Pi...  http://blog.xebia.com/2014/08/25/docker-on-a-raspberry-pi/

  A few items...

* As others have pointed out, the Java plugin is a major security hole,
  a cross-platform equivalant of Active-X.  Remove, or disable the
  plugin.

* As I pointed out on June 22nd, I've gone hog wild with creating
  separate profiles for websites I often visit.  Here's a snippet from
  my ~/.icewm/menu file that sets up part of the launchbar...

menu WEBsets firefox {
  prog DSLR firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P dslreports
  prog GLICE firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P glice
  prog GCL firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P gcl
  prog GRAPHS firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P graphs
  prog HFBOARDS firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P hfboards
  prog SLASHSOY firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P slashsoy
  prog SNOW firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P snow
  prog STREAMS firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P streams
  prog WXFORUM firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P wxforum
  prog WXSHORT firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P wxshort
  prog WXLONG firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P wxlong
  prog WUWT firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P wuwt
  prog YOUTUBE firefox /usr/bin/firefox -new-instance -P youtube
}

  If you run "top" in a really wide term (e.g. 120 or 130 columns), you
can see breakdowns for which instance is using how much resources.  This
can help you determine which websites are the problem.  *IMPORTANT* This
will only work if the command lines differ from each other.  Specifying
a profile name is sufficient.  Here's the drill...

1) Set up a wide term, at least 120, if not 130 columns wide

2) Run "top -c" in the term.  Alternately, you can run "top" and then
tap the "c" key to toggle *FULL* commandline display on/off.

3) Tap the "o" key (lowercase "owe") for case-insensitive filtering.
Uppercase "O" selects case-sensitive filtering.

4) You'll be prompted like so
add filter #1 (ignoring case) as: [!]FLD?VAL

5) Type in the following line exactly and press {ENTER}
COMMAND=firefox

This will match any line containing the substring "firefox" as part of
the commandline.  Note that if you prefix it with "!", the filter will
show every line *NOT* containg "firefox" in the commandline. i.e.
!COMMAND=firefox

  You'll get something resembling the output in my attachment, which is
rather wide.  Then you can see which instance is using how much
resources.

  Showing my age here, I like oldies music.  An interesting site is

they give the direct stream URL on their homepage.  If I try
http://s7.voscast.com:8376 or http://www.fun45s.com/listen.pls in
firefox, firefox asks for a .pls handler, and I point it to mpg123.  It
doesn't work.  No music.  But if I run mpg123 direcly from the
commandline like so...

mpg123 http://s7.voscast.com:8376

...it works.  Can I set up firefox to handle pls files direcly, or is
there a player that firefox can invoke?

Most of the times, I just have high cpu usage when visiting pages running
flash. That?s when I can start listening my fan and cpu working. :p

Also, which version of firefox are you running?

It works for me in Firefox.  It's currently playing The Four Seasons
"Let's Hang On".  I didn't do anything to get it to work.

Browser != OS.

_even_ Chrome gets confused from time to time.

I don't think it's too much to ask to just "reboot" your browser.

But it's also not too much to ask to hope for the browser to not be
*too* dramatically memory leaky.

And It sure seems like the browsers have gotten memory leaky, even
without resorting to Flash and Java.  It looks to me like Javascript, which
is pretty well mandatory these days what with all the "web applications"
using AJAX and such, can chew great gobs of memory without hardly
trying.

Firefox has tab groups btw, so you can organize lots of tabs without having to
open multiple windows:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tab-groups-organize-tabs

I have no idea if a single window with tab groups versus multiple windows has
any effect on memory/performance though... my guess would be probably not...

But, I figure it's worth a mention since I've found tab groups to be more
convenient than dealing with multiple windows (e.g. you can name them, search
for a tab, easily move tabs between groups, etc.).


I restart Firefox/IceWeasel periodically when I noticed the memory usage is
getting high. At the very least, it reduces the memory footprint because it
doesn't reload tabs on reboot until you first focus on them (at least, that's
the way I have my settings configured), so a reboot still saves your tabs but
won't consume any resources for the tabs you're not actually using.

I dunno, I am not too quick to jump on blaming the browser as "memory
leaky". I am willing to bet some sites are not built with your memory in
mind. Consider sites that just load and load javascript objects ad
nauseum.  Should the browser say : "ok that's enough web site, no more java
script objects for you" ? and if it's a reasonable X for a single site ...
and you have 300 sites open .. is 300X ok for your computer?

This is not a simple problem, so I think it's ok to ask a user to "be
considerate" of their own memory/ system resources (heaven forbid the user
knowa a smidge about how her/his computer works )

I see plugins being mentioned, but Add-ons / Extensions (Firefox can't seem
to agree on what they're called) are also a big source of memory leaks.

I start to doubt that it even has to do with the "headline" site.
Ad-supported sites will be obliged to serve up whatever their
advertisers decide to serve.  I can imagine a lot of room for
badly-designed javascript, videos and Ajax there.

Right.

I would like each "compartment" to be isolated and instrumented.  This
would give me the tools I need to kill the piggy tab, not the whole
browser.  It would give me the tool to decide whether to visit a site
in future or not.

What's a compartment?  Naively, I'd say a tab.  But maybe there is
some kind of session concept for a site or set of federated sites that
needs to be accounted for.

Being a dumb user, I immediately jump to solutions before getting to
the problem stage.

The problem:

	The browser is piggy.

	More focused: some sites make heavy demands.  I need tools
	to limit their dammage, or at least limit the dammage I have
	to inflict on myself to recover from that site's dammage.

I've whined about this before.  Perhaps I'm being thick-headed not
accept earlier suggestions but they haven't appealed to me.

Walter just suggested running a whole bunch of different browsers, 
creating the compartmentalization that I'm asking for.  The the technique 
he uses is sane but surely Firefox can do better.

No, it isn't like Active-X.  Totally different security model.

Active-X: total trust in signed plug-ins

Java: sandbox the application so that it isn't able to do unauthorized

were likely and have been implementation failures.

Docker would certainly be nice. Alas, the best I've come up with so
far to get Linux running on Android is with GNURoot. This gets me a
mostly-working Debian environment with X, twm, apt-get etc.

I whipped up some preliminary notes yesterday
<https://gist.github.com/psema4/c1545694272b1939b429> (includes links)
but there are some notable issues:

- This isn't really a tutorial yet; it's more a collection of notes
- There are some significant issues, like not being able to run xterm

That said, some simple X apps like xeyes & xclock run fine when run
from the terminal.

GNURoot is similar in some ways to linuxonandroid but it doesn't
require root (likely the source of a number of errors noted in my
gist).  LOA is fairly decent if all you need is a shell but my
experiences with X were quite awful (it was unusably slow)

There are plenty of VM's on the market for older, smaller machines.
Haven't seen much for x86 though :(

That's interesting.  I originally thought so too, but others said that
it didn't work out that way.  (This was years ago.)

Can you really use this to figure out which tab is eating CPU?  Bonus: 
eating memory?

It seems like it'll provide memory consumption, but not CPU consumption.

See URL
    chrome://memory-redirect

I think memory consumption is more interesting than CPU consumption,
myself...

Yes, take a look at the Task Manager in Chromium, e.g.
http://www.geniosity.co.za/genwp/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/google-chrome-task-manager.png


Though, there are a ton of other reasons not to use Chromium -- Mozilla's
support for open standards, open internet, Chrome/Chromium phone home stuff, etc.

  Thanks for that.  It encouraged me to dig deeper.  I set up a "streams"
profile for internet radio and TV streams.  My "youtube" profile plays
it without any problems but "streams" didn't.  I opened up the "Edit
Preferences" menu on both profiles and stepped through a bunch of items
side-by-each.  I discovered that...

* there were entries for "MP3 audio (streamed)" and "PLS file" in the
  "streams" profile, but no entries in the "youtube" profile

* the "streams" profile somehow had AbiWord associated as the handler
  for "MP3 audio (streamed)".  I *KNOW* that I had been pointing to
  mpg123, so I don't really understand how that happened.

* I changed "Action" to "Always ask", and it now works automatically,
  without even asking.  Go figure.

  I wanted to get rid of the entry entirely, to duplicate the setup in
my "youtube" profile, but I couldn't figure out how to do it from the
menu.  A bit of Google searching turned up...
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/set-how-firefox-handles-different-file-types
which says...

  I wasn't going to accept that.  I closed both browsers ("youtube" and
"streams"), opened up 2 xterms, and dove into the profile directories
for my "streams" and "youtube" profiles.  A bit of grepping showed that
the file "mimeTypes.rdf" in the "streams" profile had a block like so...

  <RDF:Description RDF:about="urn:mimetype:audio/x-mpegurl"

    <NC:handlerProp RDF:resource="urn:mimetype:handler:audio/x-mpegurl"/>
  </RDF:Description>

  There was no such entry in the "youtube" mimeTypes.rdf.  I did not
feel comfortable editing the xml file, but I did the next best thing.  I
backed up the "streams" mimeType.rdf, and copied over the version from
my "youtube" profile.  Now everything works.

  This brings up something else I remember about mimeTypes.rdf.  On my
system /usr/bin/gimp is a symlink to /usr/bin/gimp-2-8 and
/usr/bin/gnumeric is a symlink to /usr/bin/gnumeric-1.12.17.  I don't
know if Firefox still does it, but a few years ago I ran into some
"helpful" behaviour, equivalant to "Clippy helpfulness".  If Firefox
asked for a handler, and you pointed it to a file that was a symlink, it
"helpfully" de-referenced the filename.  So if I told it to use
"/usr/bin/gnumeric" for "*.xls", it selected "/usr/bin/gnumeric-1-12-17"
as the handler.  Of course, the next minor version bump update to
gnumeric broke that association.  Just as bad is what happens with sox.
"play" and "rec" are symlinks to sox which does different things and
expects different parameters.  Pointing to "play" or "rec" results in
pointing to "sox".  I ended up manually editing mimeTypes.rdf to point
to the file I actually wanted.

and that the information was submitted by the shipper about 18 minutes

  I understand the differences "under the hood", but conceptually, at an
abstract level, it's the same.  A diesel-engined car has a different
powersource than a gasoline-engined car or an electric car.  But in the
end, they accomplish the same task, i.e. moving a few people and some
groceries around.  And they're all capable of getting into accidents.

  Same thing with Java and Active-X, they involve downloading code from
a webpage and executing it on your machine.  And they're all capable of
security breaches.  Yes, they're different "under the hood", but the
results are often the same.

Not quite.  Active-X downloads and executes native code on your machine.
Java downloads byte code and executes it in a virtual machine (which is
not the same as running directly on your machine).  Unfrotuantely the java
virtual machine has to provide methods to make things actually happen
and those have often had problems too, although generally nowhere near
as bad as what active-x allows by design.

I see from another message you already solved your problem with playing the 
audio stream. My machine played the sound using the original URL with no 
problem. Just as an FYI for those "playing along at home" (no pun intended), 
you can put the URL ending in ".pls" in to VLC and it plays the stream.

Another trick with .pls files if you want to play the stream in something 
that doesn't handle the .pls files directly is to use wget to retrieve the 
.pls file then look inside it. It is just a text file and contains the URL 
with port number that you can put into another player program. I've used 
that trick so I could use RealPlayer to play audio streams.

Another solution is to use the Tunein app on a tablet or smart phone. 
You can select from several "radio stations" that way, including some
that won't play on Linux, at least not without additional help.

I would place more of the blame on the (childish) reaction from Ian and 
others. From what I've seen, the resignations all are based on constant 
abuse and stress.

Have they considered Pythian? They are a DBA mercenary shop. We love them.
Very few places need a DBA all the time. You get smart DBA people when you
need them and don't pay when you don't needs them.

How dynamic is the environment?

Do they have a back-log of DBA work but would other wise need little DBA
"touch"?

Many of the environments I manage don't need a DBA full time.

And they have on-call options and all that.

They treat us well here.

I like using Trello[1] (it's the closest to yellow stickies and

Message-ID: <CAKWRq5izAdUJAQqwr+AZi=-e9rHajNiaeZCtf7558o9L4h1oLg@mail.gmail.com>

I have an old workstation with an Asus P5Q motherboard, Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz
and 6 500Gb drives. I've only done a few Ubuntu installs, and I'm having
trouble getting past a problem with installing on a RAID device - my guess
is that it was a problem with master boot record or something. Not sure if
I have done something quite bad, but for some reason it no longer even
shows BIOS stuff (yes, I've checked the cabling), and the power source
doesn't sound quite normal for a few seconds after power on. Please contact
me (offlist if that is netiquette here) with suggestions of who could help
me with this fairly simple hardware/sysadmin task, either yourself or an
organisation or person.

Thanks,

Right you are...

You can't expect volunteers to put up with the abuse that paid staff are
paid
to take.

>From the comments from the fellow that was working on systemd packaging,
Tollef Fog Heen,  I think there was a further, rather broader, poisonous
thing
going on, namely that a faction of those strongly against systemd were
behaving spitefully.

This parallels the way a lot of political debate goes, these days; I gather
that our municipal Fords were seeing a lot of abusive comments, as,
doubtless, did Olivia Chow, and, based on the "it's like ISIS coming to
Toronto!!!" bit, doubtless John Tory saw some of this.

The "GamerGate" thing sounds like it had a dose of the same.

I think I'm seeing it just about any time someone picks up a rock
nearby anything that has the least bit of controversy around it; you
discover that there are dreadful people saying corrosively horrible
things.

What's awful is that there are groups of people prepared to dump
poisonous vitrol, I would think, in an attempt to convince the
targets to give up and leave.

It would be pretty terrible if that led to the Debian project getting
severely hobbled.  It's awful that people that don't like systemd
(and I don't count myself too much a fan; it definitely concerns
me, technically) aren't trying to do things that are helpful to the
project, but rather pouring acid into the works.

I'm potentially an "opponent of systemd in Debian"; I don't want
the vitrol-pourers that were harassing Tollef Fog Heen to
be imagined to be part of "my side".  I don't want that nonsense
associated with me.

Remember that the 27" refers to the nominal diagonal size
of a monitor.

The Dell U2713HM is 25" wide, with a 23.5" side display area.

these say 24" on the box, but I can't see them doing that on a 27"
advertised monitor, but will check now model number.

Get out a tape measure or ruler and see if it's closer to 27" or 24"
diagonally.

s2440L is what they sent 24" diag. :(
Them going back.
Interesting to see if everyone else will get these "substitutes"
I would assume they will catch the issue (maybe their sku# are mixed up),
and will take back refund, but not issue the
actual advertised monitor.
What's that saying again, if it looks to good to be true ...... :(
Maybe with some luck some people here that ordered them will get 27", but I
seriously doubt it.
At least they cover shipping cost back. I should ask them with the screw up
if they would give me some
$$ off one of their 4k monitors.

So it actually is a 24" monitor - and therefore the specs on the website
are way off as well.   Ugly.

I called Walmart and tried to cancel my order. They said I can't cancel 
it at this point, but I can reject it when it arrives and not pay the 
return fee.

I should have known better...

Agreed, Chris.

And I'm not really even a Debian fan, let alone systemd.

Even though I use both.

On the Walmart website, the S2440L is $1,499.99(!!!) and out of stock.  Too
funny...

Looks like they mixed up the prices on their website:

http://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/dell-24-1920x1080-led-monitor/6000189477898

Although, that price is way off as well, so there might be a third monitor
on their site that is also incorrectly priced.

This assuming you don't luck out and actually get the 27"?
Actually i expected to be 27" and just be an error and get caught before
shipped out.

I've saved (and screenshotted) their sale page. I am tempted to insist 
on getting the advertised monitors for the advertised price. If nothing 
else, I'll have ample evidence to insist they take it back and cover all 
costs (I'm starting to doubt the CSR telling me they'd not charge return 
shipping...)

And it turns out the the picture that Walmart posted was of the
S2440L. I noticed that it was different than Dell's picture of the
U2713HM but I didn't know which monitor it actually was. I was hoping
they just got the pictures mixed up, not the actual product.

Mine will be refused or returned as well. Delivery is scheduled for tomorrow.

Says on the web site, they don't have to honour pricing errors (if caught),
but they do pay for return shipping.

In what way does the power supply not sound normal? Does it sound like the 
bearings on the power supply fan are going and the fan needs to be replaced? 
I've had that happen with a couple of power supplies.

Some times it works out, i got a 1400$ LG 50" from future shop years ago
for 1000$,
they caught error, but still allowed, i think as long as the error is >=
their cost, they let it go.

Just curious; does the UPC of the 24" monitor you received match the
UPC given on your Walmart receipt (0088411609164)?

I think it's okay to diagnose the problem on the list, I'm interested in
weird and esoteric failures

I second what Kevin is saying.

You are probably experiencing some sort of hardware failure in either power
supply or motherboard that could have been triggered by switching the
computer on and off a few times.

You can open power supply case and visually examine for any burn marks or
defective capacitors.
Try unplugging raid controller and see if the system loads bios.
If that doesn't help try several combinations of memory modules -- the
system probably doesn't have ECC memory and that might be causing problems.

If that doesn't work, It might not be worthwhile diagnose the error,
because you will need:
(1) a working power supply to verify that power supply is at fault
(2) a working motherboard -- and plugging it it might be a bit of a chore.

You can also try going to canadacomputers do diagnostics but they could be
expensive.

It's probably much more time efficient to get new cpu/memory/motherboard
combo along with new power supply and transplant it into an old case.

Alex.

Hmmm.  I'm sitting around waiting for my delivery.

Do you think that refusing to accept the delivery will improve or
reduce my chances of getting a 27" one in the end?

Don't see how you can refuse, the packing slip shows the 27", you only know
what you got once open.

Have you processed your return yet? Do you have to pay for return 
shipping and then ask for a refund, or do they send you a shipping 
label, or ... ?

Just been instructed to wait for details, but they said i would likely get
a label in email that is used to return
via courier, and I assume pre-paid by WalMart.

Ah, ok.

Any word yet on whether they're going to honour the deal and replace 
them with the listed model?

Mine just came. 2 were in a brown box and the 3rd was the normal box and 
was 24". So I rejected the order. Now I'll call them and see what they 
say...

OK, so I asked for the to resend the proper monitors and got a decidedly 
uncommitting response, surprise...

They're going to get back in touch in "3 to 5 business days" with a 
"resolution". They wouldn't promise to call me, so I'll follow up on 
Friday if I haven't heard from them by then. If I don't get closure by 
next Wednesday, I'll do a charge-back, which would suck.

What if the cure for cancer is trapped in the mind of a person without 
access to education?

Subject: [GTALUG] ffmpeg question
Message-ID: <546CC750.4070302@gmail.com>

Hello,

For some here the answer will probably be know right away. That is why I 
am writing, after long googling.

I would like to create a sort of video presentation from images. 
However, I would like that every slide (image) is displayed for a 
different time duration. This is just the first step; next i would like 
to combine voice with that, but it is probably another problem, for later.

Hence, I have a sequence of images y-%2d.png

The following works for me:

ffmpeg -framerate 1/10 -i y-%2d.png -c:v mpeg4 -vf 
"fps=2,format=yuv420p" out.mp4

And the following works, too:

ffmpeg -r 1/2 -start_number 7 -i y-%2d.png -c:v mpeg4 -vf 
"fps=2,format=yuv420p" out.mp4

However, how to control the time of displaying individual images? Is 
that possible at all?

I thought that something like this may work:

ffmpeg -r 1/5 -i y-01.png -r 1 -i y-02.png -c:v mpeg4 -vf 
"fps=2,format=yuv420p" out.mp4

It does not. The first image is displayed, only.

Kind regards from Poland,
zb.

I have used PhotoFilmStrip and also Imagination. One of them does the 
individual time duration, can't remember which.

Thanks, Lennart and John for suggestions.

I suspect that it was the right idea that ffmpeg can not do this. I 
would prefer rather to have a command from terminal where everything is 
there, not an external program (though I did them already installed and 
will try one day).

However, just after posting to this list (that is an advantage of 
writing here; that stimulates own thinking) an idea, a simple one, come:

Well... instead of changing the time of displaying an individual image, 
I could instead create a number of copies of every image, according to 
the need (the time of display), enumerate them accordingly, and.. thats 
it! In other world, instead of controlling the time of display, I would 
rather adjust the number of copies of identical images. For a 
presentation with a few tens of images this is a prefectly convenient 
solution around the problem.

At least photofilmstrip says it can be driven from the command line for
batch processing.

The description on the website does indicate it is 24". If it said 27" 
before they have corrected the listing.

If you ordered one, kept it, and have put it in to use, what are your 
impressions of it?

It clearly said 2560x1440 Dell U2713HM.

And looking at the URL:
http://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/dell-27-2560-x-1440-led-ips-monitor/6000189477880

Seems pretty clear that it is a Dell, 27", 2560x1440, LED backlight,
IPS panel, monitor.  Not sure how else one could read that.

And the current description says:

  2560x1440 WQHD resolution: Over 3.6 million pixels provide amazing
  clarity on a spacious 27" LED-backlit display.
  Accurate color right out of the box: Carefully color calibrated at
  the factory, the U2713HM monitor features more than 99-percent sRGB
  color space for impressive color from the moment you set it up.

And then the right side says 24", which contradicts the main description.

So the resolution does not exist in a 24" that is listed, the model
listed is a 27", they just changed 27 to 24 in a few places, but it is
still all wrong.

It is now listing 24", but it wasn't earlier. In any case, it's _still_ 
listing 1560 x 1440, but the one they're shipping is 1920 x 1080. It's 
not even close to the one originally advertised.

The title says 24, but notice the description still calls it 27" and
still uses the Dell model number of the 27".

I see they also have the 10bit panel version for $350:

http://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/dell27-2560-x-1440-ips-led-monitor/6000189477877

Are they going to claim that is wrong too?

As far as I can tell, Dell lists the U2713H at $1000 right now, and I
think 'CA' just means canadian packaging (french instructions included?)

zb,

You could create a short, temporary intermediate video for each frame:

ffmpeg -r 1/5 -i y-01.png -c:v mpeg4 -vf "fps=2,format=yuv420p" out.mp4
ffmpeg -r 1/10-i y-02.png -c:v mpeg4 -vf "fps=2,format=yuv420p" out.mp4

5seconds for the first and 10seconds for the second ( and so on and so
forth... )

Then concatenate each video:
FFmpeg FAQ: How can I join video files?
<http://ffmpeg.org/faq.html#How-can-I-join-video-files_003f>
FFmpeg Wiki: How to concatenate (join, merge) media files
<https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/How%20to%20concatenate%20%28join%2C%20merge%29%20media%20files>

This will allow you to do what you need to from the command line but this
is a very awkward and cumbersome way. Probably be much easier to use a
video editor.

They also corrected the model number in the Specifications section
from U2713HM to S2440LCA. Everything else appears to be unchanged.

Note that the UPC code specified has always been the correct one for
the 24" S2440L. I bet this is what counts since that's probably what
they scan to assure that they're shipping the correct item.

The picture shown for this one is of one of Dell's touch screen
monitors. I'm guessing what you would receive is the S2240T 22" model,
since Dell's regular price for it is $369.99, which is $20 more than
the Walmart price.

It looks like all their listings are messed up:
http://www.walmart.ca/en/electronics/computers/monitors/dell/N-1856+1020854

They have a 24" monitor for $3,499.97
A 32" for $799.97
another 24" for $1,499.97

They're all over the map.  Someone obviously put all the Dell monitor
listings in wrong.

My receipt shows I purchased the 27", and when a 24" arrived just now I
took pictures of it, refused delivery, and emailed Walmart showing
incorrect item and asking when the correct item would arrive.

The price of the 27" U2713 is now $349 (vs $834 regular $729 sale price on
dell.ca (was $259 when I purchased), and the 30" U3014 at Walmart.ca is
$349 vs Dell's normal price of $1599 discounted now to $1199. The Walmart
page lists a Dell model number that varies slightly in the letters at the
end compared to the Dell site. Buying now, I'd go for the 30".

I expect this to be a mistake, too. All their Dell monitors are screwed 
up combos of prices, descriptions and PNs.

I'd just stay the heck away from walmart at this point.

I called them just now for update, they are still looking into it, i
mentioned price had gone up 90$ on what I had ordered (not received) and if
they would honour first price, but they couldn't comment. If they do sell
it for 350$ now,
I will at least get one, but now price is getting closer to their 4k dells,
so have to think about it, now of course
their 4k price may be out of sync, but it is closer to the best price i
have seen else where. 350$ is still less then
1/2 the typical low price, but given as you say how screwy their prices
are, I have little confidence the 350$ is going
to stick. Worst part is, if 350$ isn't going to stick, they will still be
shipping all these out to customers incorrectly.
Maybe with a little luck Dell screwed up its bulk custom pricing to WalMart
and walmart will be able to honour and Dell will eat it. (ok i can dream).

Retailers are obligated to honour advertised prices. There was a Dell ad in
a newspaper with an error in the price for a laptop that I was able to make
them honour about 10 years ago. Keep your invoice once you get it. Here's a

Walmart likely has effective lawyers and

    http://www.walmart.ca/en/help/legal/terms-of-sale

    2. Rejection or Cancellation of Orders
    - Inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information

likely covers this situation I might guess (I am not a lawyer).

Well listing a description and model number from Dell is what a customer
can make sense of.  UPC means nothing.

Since when? I suspect Dell honoured it out of PR concern, not because 
they felt obligated.

"E&OE" is all they need.

Subject: [GTALUG] [OT] Dead motherboard or dead CPU?
Message-ID: <546E7C32.1030208@ve3syb.ca>

Greetings, all.

Someone recently reported a problem booting their computer. I've had my 
first ever major failure of a system where I can't boot my machine. My 
situation is a little different than in the previous thread about a boot 
problem. FYI, my machine is an HP m7680n with an Intel Core 2 Duo CPU that I 
have had for several years and gets a lot of use every day.

When the machine powers up all the fans start spinning and the drives do 
their initial power on reset activities. The CPU doesn't seem to warm up 
AFAICT (unless I haven't let the system run long enough for it to warm up).

The first time I had a problem starting up the system I power cycled the 
machine a few times and got it to boot. I did that on three consecutive days 
but starting with the fourth day power cycling the machine is no longer able 
to kick the machine in to showing signs of life.

A POST card shows ---- instead of any actual code. All the LEDs on the POST 
card light that are related to power supply voltages. CLK is also lit up and 
the RESET LED comes on briefly at power up and power down. The IRDY and 
FRAME lights are always off.

I have tried to boot after pulling all plug-in cards and even after also 
pulling the RAM and disconnecting the SATA drives. The power supply is a 
Corsair TX650M that is only a few months old. The separate four pin 12V 
connector to the MB is reading within tolerance.

There are no signs of bad capacitors on the MB (ie. none that have bulges on 
the top). I don't have an ESR meter to propery test the individual capacitors.

Am I looking at a motherboard failure or is it possible the CPU has died? I 
read the C2D is quite reliable so CPU failure seems less likely than an MB 
failure but anything is possible when dealing with electronics.

Cheers!

Kevin.

Hey there,

I still have my old, original Cubox Dev Platform from a few years ago. When
I power it on now though I don't get any indication it is booting up at all.

I tried looking for newer boot/OS images to load on the SD card but
everything now seems to be for the Cubox-i.

Anyone have laying around or know where I could find something like this?

I thought I'd add a follow up to my to how I ended up to the whole story.
(I'll try not to rant)

In short, Raspberry Pi works as a router (hardware-wise is a massive
overkill) but not worth setting up as a residential access point, because
of the following issues that cropped up:

0 Raspberry Pi Ethernet port is auto-sensing, no need for crossover cables.
That bit helped me to retain my sanity.

1. Raspberry Pi doesn't come with built-in wireless card, so there are no
wireless drivers shipped with OS image (which is only 76MB in size) --
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi . You will have to figure out
yourself where to find drivers and then manually resolve dependencies. opkg
(OpenWrt package manager) helps, but there's still a lot of work that has
to be done manually.

2. Serial port works, in the usual raspberry pi configuration --
http://www.adafruit.com/product/954, however login console is not
configured, so all yo can see there are the boot messages. You can't access
the Internet using ethernet as WAN interface and configure everything
through serial console.

2. Having only one ethernet port means that you can't connect to the
Internet through Raspberry Pi in order to configure wireless; you have to
configure wireless before you can use the only ethernet port as a WAN
interface.

I found this protocol helps having internet connection through host
wireless interface and ssh access to a raspberry pi through ethernet:
    * Connect to wireless
    * /sbin/route -a | grep default (write down IP address from the second
column -- Gateway)
    * Connect to Raspberry Pi ethernet port
    * /sbin/route del default gw
    * /sbin/route add default gw <value from step 2>
At this point you should be able to access the Internet and Raspberry Pi at
the same time.


4. Once you get wireless working now you can assign WAN to ethernet
interface, you have to be careful, if something goes wrong at that stage,
there's no undoing it, and  you have to start from the beginning.
At this point command 'dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=owrt_bak.img bs=1M count=80'
becomes really useful. Also if you need to customize your subnet address do
it before configuring wireless.

5. There's no assignment of network devices for wireless cards in Barrier
Breaker, so most of the knowledge you have from configuring low-level
wireless  on Linux is no longer applicable to OpenWRT, however dmesg and iw
are still around.
OpenWrt uses radio0...radionN wlan.config settings, that could later be
assigned a particular interface if needed; however the card I was
using(tl-wn722n) had 3 radioN interfaces, of which only one (radio2) was
actual hardware that was doing something, which could be very confusing.

6. Host AP/Encryption packaging has become a mess, there are three
alternative systems (hostapd, wpa_supplicant and wpad). I ended up using
wpad, however package hostapd-common was still required.

As I mentioned I used TL-WN722N(ath9k_htc), usb dongle. It's not fast or
compact, but is very linux-friendly. Works flawlessly in AP mode. Here are
the packages required to get the wireless and this card going.

hostapd-common
iw
kmod-ath
kmod-ath9k-common
kmod-ath9k-htc
kmod-cfg80211
kmod-crypto-aes
kmod-crypto-arc4
kmod-crypto-core
kmod-mac80211
kmod-mac80211-hwsim
wpad

This is the package directory for Barrier Breaker / BRCM 2708 --
http://downloads.openwrt.org/barrier_breaker/14.07/brcm2708/generic/packages/base/

7. You end up with a rat nest of wires: 2x Power(rpi & dsl modem), 1x
Network (dsl modem to rpi), 1x Wireless extension cable(optional), and no
straightforward way of diagnosing/rebooting the system for non-technical
people.

All in all, it wasn't worth it to use Raspberry Pi for this project, I
should have gotten TD-W8961ND and saved myself a whole lot of time, however
the combination of Raspberry PI + OpenWRT offers a lot of potential:
 * Once everything was running further setup was a breeze, the same
hardware can be used for NAS, although SAMBA and NTFS have severe
limitation on Raspberry PI
  * For VPN, SSH, CUPS and  other tasks that require more
CPU/Memory/Storage than consumer router can offer (free memory or cpu never
went below 94% as  I was testing out the set up), I was using 48MB out of
3.6GB of storage on main partition. (on a $5 SD card)
  *  The combination Network port/USB/WIFI   is a relatively inexpensive
way to either put hardware that only supported Ethernet on wireless
network, or to add network capabilities to older plotters/scanners/printers.

So if any of these sounds good, the steps to put a Raspberry Pi-powered
OpenWrt are the following:

1. Install SD image on SD Card
2. Connect to ethernet port and set up subnet
3. Configure wireless, while using your laptop's wifi/eth1 connection to
get all the drivers/troubleshoot wireless hardware
4. Unplug ethernet and connect to RPI box through wifi, make sure that both
web interface and SSH is accessible
5  Backup.
6. Move eth0 interface from Lan to Wan group.
6. Configure Wan Interface
7. (Optional), Unplug Raspberry Pi, resize root partition on SD card from
the host machine using (fdisk/resize2fs) or Parted
8. Backup
9. Done

Alex.

which is 350$ at wally, double everywhere else?
i could call them and say, "are you sure of price", but hmmmmm.
I think i will , its their nickel for return shipping. Maybe the points
will even stay on my credit card (but doubt it).

You're more patient than I...

If they don't ship me the original monitors on the receipt, then I'll 
just want my money back and be done with it. I don't trust them to get 
another order right.

No they will revert CC charge they said, so not worried about that, i think
i will just tell them straight
out the price is 50% less then others, and if they are sure of it, send it,
they will probably
their whole internal dell monitor pricing group is on crack, and that will
be that :)

Boo, I had hoped for reship but expected the refund. Oh well.

Thanks for the update! I guess I'll see if any real deals pop up next week.

Message-ID: <CAMOmKH+L0m8xvbBizW7EW_FzRDvyuogJJj0XmrqvJxWAPeMsCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Could anyone tell me a software I can open the .asec file? I saved some
passwords in the keeper application with my old android phone. I then
backup the file to my laptop. However, I am not able to open the file. the
file name is com.callpod.android_apps.keeper-2.asec. I need to open it so
that if by accident, I cannot get access to my old cellphone, I still have
access to those passwords.

Many thanks in advance!

have a good weekend,

Frank Yu

  What do you mean by "open"?  vim should be be able to open any file
that you have read privileges on.  Are you trying, as regular user, to
open a file that is owned by root with permissions 600?

  The passwords may be hashed/encrypted/whatever in the file.  In that
case, you would need to have the master key that was used to to encrypt
them, and possibly the linux equivalent of your keeper application.

Weren't you hampered by the incredibly slow USB ports on the Raspberry Pi?

I do agree that (amongst many other things) Raspberry Pis make great
wireless print servers. I now have a networked Epson LQ dot-matrix
printer, and a networked Roland DXY pen plotter. And consequently, a
bloody noisy basement ?

I didn't run any tests but the Internet connection but the performance of
Raspberry Pi  didn't seem to be any different than of any other router. The
USB controller is slow compared to modern x86 hardware, but as far as
embedded devices go, it's pretty fast.

I think the general slowness of RPI comes from SD card controller, which is
limited to Class 4, i.e. 4MB/sec, and can it get a lot slower on sparse
writes, that combined with a single CPU that gets blocked on IO wait makes
everything feel pretty sluggish (remember how fast Pentium II systems
were?), but as long as local storage doesn't get touched -- USB controller
is more than adequate.

I think I have Debian loaded on mine at the moment.  Let me check on
Monday at work (which is where the cubox currently is sitting).

Well short of swapping parts it can be hard to determine the problem.
Could be motherboard, power supply, CPU, ram, video card (if not onboard).

Generally under Linux a CPU does not get blocked due to I/O waiting.
All processes might get blocked due to I/O waits, at which point the
CPU cannot make progress because there is no work to do.  But that's
a slow I/O problem, not a slow processor problem.

The RP does have a slow processor.  I would guess that it would be
somewhere in the middle of the pack compared with wireless routers'
processors.  But they have specialized hardware for networking (like a
pair of ethernet ports and an ethernet switch).

As always, performance guesses are unreliable (even mine!).
Measurement is called for if it matters.

Actually surprisingly many have only one port and use vlans on the switch
to create the WAN versus LAN ports.  Some even attach the wifi to
the switch.

As soon as I notice discrepancies in web pages about items I wonder what 
information is correct and what is incorret. It prompts me to contact the 
seller for clarification if it is an item I would consider buying. It helps 
the seller by pointing out typos they may not have caught when poasting a 
listing. It helps me as I verify what is actually being sold and at what price.

All these apparent errors in listings of Dell monitors would generate a lot 
of inquiries to verify what is actualy being sold and at what price before 
placing any orders.

I contacted Walmart, via their web contact form, about another "too
good to be true" listing, previously mentioned in this thread:
<http://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/dell27-2560-x-1440-ips-led-monitor/6000189477877>

I asked if they could verify that the description was correct, and if
I ordered, would I actually receive a model U2713HCA, as given in the
Specifications section. I also pointed out that the picture provided
did not match what Dell shows for that model.

Here's the response I received:
"We apologize, as the description and picture for the item are
supplied by the vendor for the product, and we cannot clarify on our
end. Typically the description will be accurate to the item, rather
than the picture. If you wanted to order, and the item is not as you
would need it, You may return your online purchase either to your
local store or by mail within 90 days of receiving it, unless
otherwise noted in our returns policy. Please refer to our return
policy by following the link below. ..."

I also had previously contacted them by phone with similar questions
and got essentially the same answer.

For anyone contemplating ordering this one, note that in a previous
post I guessed that you would probably get a model S2240T 22" touch
screen monitor. This was based on the provided picture and price. I
have since found a web page that confirms that the UPC code that
Walmart gives, 88411611413, is for the S2240T (look in the Manifest
section):
<http://techliquidators.com/index.cfm/p/34/i/1553892>
(The last digit of a UPC is just a check digit)

Monoprice has a good reputation as a no-nonsense source for cables and
the like.  It is a US company.  They will ship to Canada but that has
friction: shipping costs (not free), customs brokerage costs, HST,
currency exchange costs.  And, of course, no local warranty.

I seem to remember that they've been selling inexpensive 27" monitors
for a year or two.  The other source of this kind of thing is direct
from Korea.

Here's a very very long thread about these monitors from Korea:
<http://forums.redflagdeals.com/rfds-official-korean-27-2-5k-2560x1440-resolution-monitor-deals-118323>
Summary: very good price, pretty good chance of success, pretty good 
display panel, very basic electronics (only supports dual-link DVI and

Well the $33.29 US and $45.66 duty puts a dent in that deal.

?Morning,?

I have cache dns running on a postfix based mail server. The bin?d server do come up before postfix, but dns queries fail till the dns master come up.

Doesn't slave servers keep data persistent? I mean, is it normal for slave to fail resolving queries on start up if the master us down?

Thanks in advance ?

William

What's your cache time?  A cache will typically hold the data for a
short time, to keep stale data from propogating.  It might be as short
as a few minutes.  A cache certainly won't survive a reboot.

I don't know about local policy, but each DNS record has a TTL which
is supposed to limit the time it is cached.  I imagine that these
are generally honoured by a caching server to avoid overloading the other 
servers.

The original TTL was 24 hours.  But that's a bit long these days.  It's
a balance between "overloading" and stale addresses.  Upper level
servers tend to have long times, local ones shorter.  Regardless, I'd
expect the cache to be empty on a system that's just been started.

Cache as cache can.  ;-)

How do you know that?  Do you know the queries William Muriithi's machine 
is making?  Do you know what DNS servers it is querying?

In a response to a DNS query, each record has its own TTL.  That TTL
depends on what the authoritative server set it to be initially and
how intermediate servers (if any) modified it (usually because it has
been aging in a cache).

You can see this with dig(1).

Hugh,

Thank you. My problem seem to be ttl issue. The ttl for my records is one hour and this system was down longer than that due to power outage.

Axfr dump from the Slave look as below.

I was referring to earlier days of the Internet, not his system.

"The units used are seconds. An older common TTL value for DNS was 86400
seconds, which is 24 hours. A TTL value of 86400 would mean that, if a
DNS record was changed on the authoritative nameserver, DNS servers
around the world could still be showing the old value from their cache
for up to 24 hours after the change."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live

As that article mentions, with that TTL, it would take a full 24 hours
for a change to be reflected.

Sorry if my message was confusing.  I don't think that setting a
longer TTL is the solution to your problem.  In fact, I don't know the
right solution.  Not really my area of expertise.

Setting a longer TTL will paper over the problem.  If the outage is
short enough, and the remaining TTLs are long enough, you will not
have a problem.  But all TTLs count down, so it is probably only luck
if you never crash with a short remaining TTL.  Adjusting TTL way high
will adjust the probabilities, but still leaves a vulnerability.

You didn't really tell us everything relevant about your problem so
I'm guessing at a few things.

Is your DNS master server on the same machine or a different one?  If
it is on the same machine, perhaps you can delay the startup of
postfix until after the master server is up.

If the server is on another machine, I don't know of an off-the-shelf
solution for all cases.  That doesn't mean that there isn't one.

If you control the master server, you could run a local slave DNS
server on the postfix machine.  That is probably the best and cleanest
solution.  Zone transfers don't have to happen in real time.  This
assumes that you only really care about queries for names in that zone.

If you don't control the master server:

A normal (not DNSSEC) way of deciding that there is no domain with
the given name is to give up after a query receives no answer after a
timeout.  Just telling postfix to have more patience might work but
has other problems.

[UNTESTED] Perhaps before starting postfix, you could do a query of a
better-be-a-sure-thing domain name with a really long timeout.
	dig @master.server known-name.ca +time=300
might do the trick (a 5 minute patience).  This might fit in the init
script.

Of course this is all a little improper.  If the server goes down
without the machine running postfix going down, you have the same old
problem.

You have a point, unless I make it full day, at some point it will
happen again.  This is in Markham and power outage is like a weekly
affair.  Petty disappointed by power supply up there.

Nope.  The master and the slave leave of different hardware.
Actually, master is an active directory while the slave is a bind
server.  The purpose of the bind server is to ensure DNS resolve fast
enough as I do a lot of DNS related checks to avoid spam coming
through.

Me too. I am wondering if removing the MX server from the VM that
should start automatically should solve the problem.

Actually bind running on MX server is actually slave.  Sorry for
mixing up cache and slave. Shouldn't both stop serving the zone in
question is the TTL has expired?   If thats not the case, I guess I am
on the wood on why its happening then as you implicitly seem to imply
it shouldn't happen with slaves.

Hmm, good idea, I could chkconfig off postfix and set it a small
script to check DNS and then bring up postifx when it resolve
successfully.  Possibly call it every 15 minutes..  Will investigate
that idea tomorrow

[checking with my 2001 edition of "DNS and BIND"]

The slave can, but need not, have a file that saves the zone across
reboots.  Clearly you want this.

Zone transfers are initiated by the slave if it reboots without such a
file.

They are also initiated if the lifetimes specified in the SOA record
have expired (refresh time, retry time, expire time, negative caching
time). NOT the same as ordinary record TTL.

(Irrelevant: zone transfers are initiated by the master when the zone data 
changes.)

Of course this is about BIND 9 in 2001.

So it looks as if a few tweeks should get you something reasonable.
