If you can, deliver it to FreeGeek. They'll re-use or refurbish it,
and if it's completely unusable they'll take it apart and get a few
semoleans from their upstream recycler.

Better them than a for-profit recycler.

Yes, that is the best answer.

# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

Subject: [GTALUG] Clean Ubuntu Install Tips
Message-ID: <557A10F9.80104@rogers.com>

I have been running Ubuntu for over a decade. Always did Internet upgrades.

But the last one, to 12.04 broke my PHP and the only solution I have 
found is to do a clean install.

I have /home on a separate drive so I expect that this is not a big 
deal. But I think a few of you might be able to offer a tips.

The system will be a desktop and also a LAMP server. I plan to install 
the desktop and then add the AMP.

I will back up the databases using mysqldump, save the Apache .conf 
files as well as fstab.

Anything else I should consider? Thanks

You could use a configuration management system to declare what the 
final state of the machine should be once you've finished. I've been 
learning SaltStack <http://docs.saltstack.com> over the last couple of 
days and I'm quite impressed. I'm using a masterless minion setup due to 
the fact that the machines that I'm deploying are intended to run behind 
a firewall with no access to the Internet. Here is a resource I found 
useful: 
<http://eon01.com/blog/using-saltstack-to-automate-vagrant-provisioning/>. 
You don't have to use Vagrant but you might want to once you see how 
easy it is to go from deploying your VM locally on VirtualBox to 
deploying to an Amazon EC2 instance, for example.

That might be a simple way to try and fix things but I wouldn't think it 
should be the only way.

You don't say in which way it is broken. You could downgrade PHP, remove all 
packages that have anything to do with PHP and reinstall from your distros 
PHP package, or you could remove all existing PHP packages and install a 
version you built from source.

Another thing is whether the problem is simply a configuration error in 
Apache. You can run some tests on PHP using 'php -a' at a command line to 
run it interactively and see if it appears to be functional or not.

I have tried many things. The problem comes when trying to install 
libapache2-mod-php5

I get this error:

dpkg: error processing package libapache2-mod-php5 (--configure):
subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
libapache2-mod-php5
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Using Google I see others have had this problem, but I have not found a 
solution.

I have followed suggestions like these (using sudo):

apt-get -f install
apt-get clean all
apt-get update

apt-get -f install

Then try:

apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

I get the error above.

Follows is the term.log:

I suggest you run post-install script directly and see what is happening
there:

sh -x /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst

Thank you for the suggestion. This is the result:

$ sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst

Stephen,

   This is how I upgrade my Fedora machines. Everything on /home stays intact because I don't reformat it.  I can switch to Ubuntu if I want.  I don't have application data on my root partition.  If I did, I would back it up regularly, and before doing a re-install.  My /etc directory is backed up weekly, automatically.

   I document my install procedure.  I post this on my website to encourage other Linux users, but my original purpose was to be able to it again, later.

I have the same result on my Debian box, when run without parameters.

but this one ends with 'exit 0':
sh -x   /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst configure

(note I run in it debug mode with "sh -x")


If it still have non zero exit from that script and you believe that
your system is fine, you can put
exit 0
in the beginning of that file (after shebang) and run

dpkg --configure -a

to fix unconfigured packages

I tried that and I get

+ return 1
+ exit 1

At the beginning I get:

no talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory

Which I am concerned about.

I'm with the others -- the problem should be fixable. I've dealt with some messy
upgrade problems at times, but I've *never* had to do a clean install. A problem
with one package should be fixable, even if the fix is tricky...

For what it's worth on backups...

- I'm a fan of automysqlbackup (in the Ubuntu and Debian repositories) for MySQL
backups, which is a wrapper script for mysqldump that compresses, rotates, saves
daily/weekly/monthly versions, notifies on error, etc.

- For filesystem backups, rsnapshot is pretty great for incremental, versioned
backups


Other packages I often install on a clean Ubuntu/Debian server:
- logwatch: log analyser
- fail2ban: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
- munin: gathers graphs for performance monitoring

Stephen, when I Googled "no talloc stackframe at
../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory"
this came up:
http://askubuntu.com/questions/477002/loadparm-c4864-leaking-memory
Hope it helps. Thanks - Aruna

Subject: [GTALUG] Swift vs Go vs Python vs Ruby
Message-ID: <557B1194.1070709@mylesbraithwaite.com>

At this week's GTALUG meeting a couple of people asked what Swift looked
like compared to other languages here is an example of a nursery rhyme:

Swift:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.swift>

Go:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.go>

Python:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.py>

Ruby:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.rb>

I also mistakenly said that Go and Swift look like Python but Go and
Swift look nothing a like. After some more research I should have said
Go and Swift look the same but take a lot of influence from Python and C.

Cool.

A few weeks ago I was reading about it. Well, not about all the 4, but
about a few differences between Go and Swift, and I found an
interesting article about it. If anyone is interested, there´s a good
reading:
