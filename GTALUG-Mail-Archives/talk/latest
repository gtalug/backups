Does anyone have a recommendation for an up-to-date postfix / dovecot
tutorial including SSL/TLS/STARTTLS?

I have turned up a few examples, but it has been a while, and they are
old and my memory is fallible.

Thanks!

I used this tutorial recently: 
<http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/> 
(without the EncFS setup). It's pretty good if you also want 
virtual_users using MySQL.

If you want to go the automated route you can use: 
<https://github.com/al3x/sovereign>. It's a bunch of Ansible playbooks 
that setup pretty much everything you would need.

Subject: [GTALUG] Booting Jessie from USB
Message-ID: <CAEnxSC6j0p2VisAcdjae24o-78ZrX2iXZVAS2LaUMjXV6eY_-Q@mail.gmail.com>

I have an Acer C720 Chromebook with Bodhi Linux installed.  I wanted
to test Debian Jessie on the machine, so I physically removed the SSD
and plugged in a 32GB USB stick (SanDisk Cruzer Ultra Fit, USB3).  I
installed Jessie on it (on an ext4 partition), and added a 5GB or so
vfat partition on the end.  When I attempt to boot from the USB stick,
GRUB comes up and works fine, but things go sideways after that.  Here
are some of the errors that I've copied ("..." indicates dropped
lines, mostly duplications):

     -----

usb 1-4: string descriptor 0 malformed (err = -61), defaulting to 0x0409
...
usb 2-1: device not accepting address 3, error -62 [repeated several
times with different numbers]
...
xhci_hcd 0000:00:14.0: Command completion event does not match command
...
Gave up waiting for root device.  Common problems:
 - Boot args (cat /proc/cmdline)
   - Check rootdelay= (did the system wait long enough?)
   - Check root= (did the system wait for the right device?)
 - Missing modules (cat /proc/modules; ls /dev)
ALERT!  /dev/disk/by-uuid/44621e45-2a15-4637-d0b8-282b63c8194b does not exist.
Dropping to a shell!
modprobe: module ehci-orion not found in modules.dep
...
(initramfs)

     -----

I've got another laptop that runs permanently off a USB stick.  Yes, I
know it's a bad idea: the point is, it can be done - and in this
instance it's meant as a temporary measure, a test of Jessie on this
machine.  I've checked the UUID of the partition in another machine,
and it's set correctly.  I tinkered with the GRUB kernel command line
arguments: Debian had inserted a number of "hints" (sorry, haven't
copied this part out) referring to which partition to boot from.  I
think they said "hd1,msdos1" and I changed them all (three?) to
"hd0,msdos1" which caused the boot process to last longer and look
more promising, but it again eventually failed out not being able to
find itself.  The Chromebook has two USB ports, one USB2 and one USB3:
the failure is the same (or very similar) booting from both.

My first reaction has been that something about the USB stick itself
is too new - but Linux mounts it fine and installed to it okay.  The
"ehci-orion" doesn't make much sense: "Orion" seems to be an ARM
chipset, and the Chromebook has an Intel Celeron 2955U in it.

Any help appreciated.

Hi Giles,

Debian Jessie is running 3.16 which doesn't support c720 hardware. If
you want to try out Debian, you either need to install wheezy ( but that
kernel doesn't support touchpad), or install any kernel that is version
3.17 or above.
I suggest you download one from experimental and install it manually --
https://packages.debian.org/experimental/kernel/linux-image-3.19.0-trunk-amd64

I've been running it for a few months on my c720 without any issues.

Alex.

That to me says either the USB key, the USB port, or (pretty unlikely)
the USB driver is broken.

It is certainly failing to start USB properly.

Well xhci is USB3.  Some USB3 controllers (In my experience ASMedia)
are awful and unstable in linux.

Try the USB2 port instead to see what happens then.

Debian's 3.16 kernel has support for the C720 as of mid january.

I find myself increasingly annoyed with youtube (even with html5), and find
relief in using scripts to access its content. Such as:

https://github.com/trizen/youtube-viewer
https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

There are also other applications like:
http://flavio.tordini.org/minitube
http://smplayer.sourceforge.net

youtube-dl is awesome.

I've also been playing around with whitey:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whitey

I can't actually get it to play properly... but the command line search is
pretty cool (though lack of thumbnails sometimes makes that difficult). I'll
typically copy the URLs to youtube-dl to view.

# LessCSS with Myles Braithwaite and a Round Table Q&A Session

*LessCSS*

LessCSS extends the CSS language to make it actually useable by adding
features like variables, mixins, functions, and a bunch of other
techniques that allow you to make your stylesheets more maintainable,
themeable, and extendible.

*Round Table Q&A Session*

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Kaiju
(384 Yonge Street).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:

I thought it would be relevant to this list. Among the new features --

https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/whats_new_in_systemd,_2015_edition/

Things recently added and being worked on:

* systemd-nspawn -- docker-like containers
* btrfs support
* firewall support based on application id and not port numbers
* moving kernel console into userspace, adding high DPI and proper
Unicode support
* resolving config file path with sysctl --edit / sysctl --cat
* network management with networkd
* auditing has indexing and is included in logging
* support of stateless systems
* resolvd -- vpn support, smart dns with support per-interface cache,
support for LLMNR
* rolling avahi into systemd  is being worked on
* journald remoting -- remote logging with http using pull and push model
* logging stack traces without gdb
* protect system/home/tmp/devices -- setup minimal namespace
environments for services
* timesyncd -- trivial  sntp client with time saving for the devices
with no rtc
* autodiscovery of swap partitions with gptd
* readahead support was dropped
* merge gummiboot into systemd (UEFI secure boot support)

I can see why people complain about featurecreep.

They look an awful lot like in-win cases to me, from some 10 to 15
years ago.  I used a few Q500s in the past (which these clearly are not),
but they look quite similar.  Then I found silverstone...

Perhaps it was just the style used back then.

Who knows, maybe in-win was the OEM for A-Open at the time for those

If you're building primitive functions as the main effort, and shipping 
products sitting on top of thgem, this scales.  Even elegant constructs 
like qef have a ton of stuff of this sort.

If, however, you're writing A dpends on B depends on C depends on A for 
any kind of A, B and C, you're creating spagetti code ( or perhaps a 
walled garden if it is intentional).  Both lead to business failure.

I'm glad that it is a sufficiently vital project to have things going on.

I'm pretty happy to see them adding things that smell like extra
services, though this shouldn't require "kernel of systemd"
involvement, surely.  For instance, if timesyncd is a wee service
where they combine some shell scripts (or such) with a service
configuration file, that's great.

I'm less enthralled with the vast variety; it does indeed look like
"scope creep."

Explain to me WHY it needs BTRFS support, why this isn't better
separated from systemd concerns.  I gather that it's intended to help
support the "containering" support, which might be OK, but when scope
creeps, I get a bit scared that the service is trying to be the
"creep" of Linux, and that's no good thing.

I suspect that just like systemd has container and virtual machine
management support, it is now adding btrfs volume and snapshot management
support (some of which might even be useful in conjunction with containers
or virtual machines).

It does seem like trying to tie too many things together.

Had you noticed there is a machined virtual machine manager in systemd?
I only noticed that recently.  And of course machinectl to go with it.
You can even do systemctl -M vmname command, to run systemctl command
inside that named vm.  I suppose that could be convinient.

I understand that a number of camera manufacturers have their own
embeded Linux already.  Like for more than 10 years.  That also
explains why I don't remember which -- too long ago.

Even my not-smart UltraHD TV has Linux in it.

When they embed Linux, Japanese companies tend to release the source
code.  Usually not in a way that you can actually build and replace
the firmware, but at least it is released.

I strongly suspect that the only reason Magic Lantern works is because
the camera already comes with Linux.  If you read blurbs, ML doesn't
replace the existing firmware, it supplements it.  But I haven't taken
the time to check.

Buy, or find someone with, a crimping tool and a short Ethernet cable is easy.

Use, or find someone with, a soldering iron and some heat-shrink

Short cables are available.  You can try the usual suspects, (Sayal,
Canada Computers etc.) or search on line.  Or, as Scott mentioned,
making Ethernet cables is fairly easy, once you get the hang of it.  If
possible, use stranded cable for patch cords.

My favorite cable place in town is infinitecables.com in Markham.
Cat 5/6 cables in any length, any colour.  Power cables too.
Lots of USB, but I don't know about shorter lengths.

Otherwise monoprice.com might be a good place to check.
Don't know if inifinitecables stocks 6 inch cat 5, but
monoprice does.

Hope that helps - cheers!

When I needed some short USB cables recently, I got them from amazon.

monoprice might be a good choice too.

They run Canon's own proprietary RTOS. Hacks like ML and CHDK have only
come about through some very patient disassembling of firmware images.
It's lucky that the cameras use fairly standard ARM cores so tools exist
to pick apart the code.

If you have a Canon PowerShot, and it's supported by CHDK, it's worth a
try. Though the user interface for the CHDK side is terrible, it adds
handy features like intervalometry, cable remote, extremely fast flash
sync, and a huge set of image and video options.

cheers,
 Stewart

Yeah, CHDK has some nice features, but it's clunky to use. To some extent,
that's because the GUI has to take place on the camera display, which is
very, very crowded - and accessed by the limited number of camera buttons
and knobs.

The gphoto2 project is apparently working on routines that would allow a
CHDK equipped Canon Point-and-Shoot to be controlled from a remote
computer. Then you could run a very nice user interface on the computer.

I'm using gphoto2 for camera control of a Canon T3i, using the Tcl
language for the GUI. I have everything working, including liveview,
although there is a bug in gphoto2 which affects this camera. (They're
working on it...)

Is anyone else on this list using gphoto2?

  That looks like what I need.  Thanks for the pointer.  I'll check more

But if necessary, I can get there from Dufferin+Steeles via YRT.

  I wasn't expecting it, but Canada Computers does have them in-store,
so I don't have to order online and pick up later

I have a dentist's appointment for teeth-scraping on Friday, and the

  Actually, it was 4 hours.  I have a bunch of spreadsheets, browser
tabs, etc, open all the time, scattered over various work areas.  Rather
than re-open them every day, I simply hibernate, using suspend-to-disk.
This way, things are where I left them.

  The past couple of months, when the machine comes up from hibernation,
the clock is a few hours ahead.  Now it's 4 hours ahead.  It was 5 hours
ahead before the switch to daylight savings time.  This looks
suspiciously like GMT.

  After reading your email, I dug deeper.  Apparently, it's just the
"kernel system time" that gets bumped forward when it comes up from
hibernation.  The BIOS clock is OK.  As a heavy-handed hack, I've
inserted the line...

OnResume 01 hwclock --hctosys

...into my /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf.  This copies over the BIOS
time to the kernel system date.  It works, but I'd really like to know
why it's necessary in the first place.

It was 3.5 hours from the time I posted.  While looking at your message
headers, I could see it was UTC, which is, at this time of the year, 4
hours ahead.

I have my computers configured to use NTP to get accurate time.  My
notebook computer often is in hybernation, but I've never seen this time
issue.

I was forced to start using git as some of the open source projects I 
work on switched to using it for maintaining their public code 
repositories. Git is different enough from the other VCS' I have used 
that it drove me batty at first. With git I often wound up with my 
checked out code "not on a branch". I've lost code changes I was working 
on while using git. That never happened while using any of the 
RCS/CVS/SVN tools. Eventually I started to get a bit of a handle on git 
and created my own cheat sheet for it.

And at the same time a lot of people won't contribute to projects because
dealing with RCS(ok no one uses that)/CVS/SVN is way too painful.
then there is bazaar, which really would be better named bizaar, as far
as the UI is concerned.

git is different, but it's different in a good way.

Now I must admit I have no idea how one can end up not on a branch.
I have never managed that as far as I recall.  Actually maybe doing a
checkout of a specific commit number will do that, but I only ever do
that when trying to investigate when something changed, certainly never
while writing code.

As a follow-up to my part of this thread, a fair bit of research on my
part suggests that yes, Oh My Zsh! is kind of the way to go.  Although
if you want to stay with Bash (and I admit I have a lot of sunk cost
there), there's Bash-it ( https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it ) which
is an attempt to replicate OMZ! for Bash.  There's also oh-my-git (
https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git ), a garish but thorough
git prompt for zsh or Bash that could act as a base for a less
brightly coloured prompt - although it requires modified fonts.

As for tracking upstreams, it's looking like the best procedure for
me, if I really want to be concerned about that all the time, is to
run "git fetch origin <whatever>" by cron: once you have local
unmerged copies, git's tools can readily tell you about the state of
the upstream without an on-the-instant network connection.  Not quite
what I'd hoped for, but when I think about how git works, it's an
acceptable compromise.

Github has developed a "Large File Storage" extension to git.  Written
in Go, open sourced.

https://github.com/github/git-lfs

This is their blog announcement:

https://github.com/blog/1986-announcing-git-large-file-storage-lfs

I haven't dealt with the problems of large files in git, but I've
heard it's ugly, so this is interesting.  I'm curious if more
experienced git users actually think this is a good idea.

I'm currently using git-annex (using an ownCloud remote) for storing 
mixtapes (large m4a and mp3 files) for a Jekyll based website I'm 
working on. It works while for me because the files never change.

I'm excited for git-lfs because most of the design directories get 
pretty large (~700MB) which makes it a pain to have to clone/pull from.

Well for one it certainly breaks the idea that the git tree is self
contained.

I think it is a solution trying to solve a problem that should be solved
some other way.

Perhaps some files are so huge they don't have any reason to be stored
in your code tree.  They may need a better designed storage system of
their own.

So I don't get it, and don't think it fits the git model at all (then
again I don't think github does either for that matter).

Subject: [GTALUG] New system audio problem
Message-ID: <5529E5FB.6090101@rogers.com>

Background:

I have run Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier versions for a number of years on an 
MSI motherboard and an AMD 3200 cpu. It finally died.

I build a new system on a ASUS H97M-E motherboard with an Intel i5 and 
16 gigs ram.

I just connected the hard drives from the old system, and was quite 
happy when the system booted and all seemed good.

Problem:

Audio is bad. Static and drops. This applies to *.flac files and online 
Youtube stuff.

But when I play *.mp4 files, the video and audio are great.

My Ubuntu system is a DLNA server and and that plays fine on the client.

So I am thinking the audio driver is not a good fit for the new chip set.

Am I on the right track? Can I get Ubuntu to update to the proper driver?

Thanks

This isn't 100% clear, but I assume that the version you are currently
running is 12.04.

Ubuntu adjusts which drivers it uses upon boot.  Unless you've wired in
some settings somewhere (eg. telling it to load certain modules or not
to load certain modules).

Sometimes mixer settings get mixed up.  Try creating a new user, log
in as that user, and see if sound works properly.  If so, some dot file
in your normal home directory has an inappropriate setting.

I assume that you have done a normal update procedure to get all
released updates to 12.04.  If not, I suggest doing so.

Perhaps 12.04LTS isn't aggressively supporting new hardware (I don't
know) because 14.04LTS is out.  Consider trying 14.04LTS from a live USB
stick -- that would allow you to test without disturbing your current
installation.  You could even try a newer release.  Or, say Fedora.

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1504120028570.6970@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I bought a cute little box (a weakness of mine): an HP Stream Mini.
It comes with Win8.1 with Bing x64 on its "HDD", a 32G M.2 SSD.  Note
that it is x64: not one of these Atoms with a crippled 32-bit UEFI.

Fedora 21 runs fine off a live USB stick.

The SSD is a fine size for Linux, but not a fine size for Win8.1 + Linux.  
So I intend to evict Windows from the SSD.  But I feel that I need to keep 
Win8.1 bootable
- I paid for it (a lame reason)
- I will likely need Win8.1 to do firmware updates
- it might be worth playing with for some purposes

I'd like to migrate Win8.1 to a USB3 device.  I just bought a 64G usb 
stick which might be perfect ($19.99 at NCIX this weekend).  Or more 
likely, a 2.5" external HDD.

Does anyone know how to migrate Windows?

Googling finds lots of moderately crappy postings about how to move
Windows to an SSD but I cannot tell if they assume that some vital
essence is left on the original drive.  (I actually wish to move the
opposite way; that ought not to be a problem.)

I've found Windows quite fragile, possibly due to piracy prevention
things.  It also seems to want to own booting and on UEFI / Secure
Boot systems this gets downright magical (i.e.  I don't understand it)

All seem to take proprietary non-Microsoft software -- one fears a
bait-and-switch.  (I bet some of the bootable ones are based on
Linux.)

I can experiment, but I thought I'd ask here first.

I haven't done this but I have found that gdisk (or gparted), which can be
run
from a live CD (I assume it would also run from a USB stick), can set up
UEFI hardware. Now as to the gotchas - - - no idea.

Please - - - would you let the list know what you actually do and what
works?

There is a lot of play with formats around Atom and Win8.1 with Bing.
There are lots of Chinese boxes that have beaten Intel to market.

I see the reasons for these developments as:

- Intel wants to defend the space that Arm has been moving into.
  They do this with heavy subsidies of Atom-based SOCs and processors.
  I think that they also do this with creating "reference platforms"
  that take much of the design work out of creating a system.

- Microsoft wants to defend the space that Android has been moving
  into.  Their attempt to run on Arm has been a market disaster.  So
  they too want to ride the Atom at the low end.  They do this by
  making Windows 8.1 free to OEMs in that space.  They also do that
  by engineering a way for Win8.1 to fit into 1G RAM / 16G flash
  systems.

The devil is in the details.  Like
- USB3 -- rare
- 1G ethernet -- rare
- Bluetooth 4.0
- what kind of WiFi
- size of RAM and flash

Few Chinese boxes intentionally support normal Linux distros.  This is
one place where Intel's Compute Stick is ahead.  I hope that the
Windows version (with more resources) can run Linux.

Qualifications to earlier statements:

- Intel has said that it will phase out subsidies.  I forget exactly
  when, but it was supposed to have already started.  I don't
  understand how they haven't been nailed by US DoJ's anti-trust guys.

- "Win8.1 with Bing" is the fig-leaf cheap SKU.  I think that the OEMs
  pay US$10 for Windows and get US$10 back for making Bing the default
  search engine.  Current terms are not publicly known.  The original
  statement from Microsoft had restrictions on tablet screen sizes
  and processor but they changed those restrictions without public
  announcement (as far as I know).

- (my inference) to limit the damage to their cash cow, Intel's cheap
  Atoms for running Windows only have 32-bit UEFI even though the
  processors are 64-bit.  As you know, Linux distros don't support
  this.  Boo.

- to limit damage to their cash cow, Intel's Atoms vary widely in how
  much physical RAM they will support.  I'm sure that this has no
  technical justification.  Most cheap ones only support 2G.  Many of
  the rest stop at 4G.  Some go to 64G and have ECC support!.nnn

- Win8.1 with Bing can fit in 16G of flash.  It does so by using the
  compressed restore image as a virtual disk (roughly speaking).  But
  Windows updates are not compressed.  So as they appear, the 16G has
  less and less space for the user's files.  I infer that Microsoft
  tries to deal with this by only installing "important" updates (the
  user can change this policy -- oops).  I think that this is going to
  end badly.

See how interesting things get when the monopolies feel a threat
coming on?

It's been a long time since I mucked with this (Windows 7, but several
years ago), but my experience agrees with yours: Windows is very
fragile about being moved.  I'd suggest that if you want to attempt to
boot Windows from an external media that you also make a pristine
image of the original HD and set that aside.  I suspect that the
second you boot the external version of Windows, it will write
breaking changes to itself and never be usable again.  I think the
only way you're going to successfully boot Windows on it again is to
wipe Linux from the original drive, and re-image it from your original
clean copy.  I may be being overly pessimistic, but I've had very poor
luck working with Windows on anything that wasn't its own original
hardware after its been installed.  Best of luck.

To another SATA disk is no big deal.  To USB is a totally different story.
Not even sure if you can.  A quick search confirms that installing
TO usb/firewire is NOT supported (at least in Windows 7).
There are ways around it, but don't expect it to always work.  See
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7-to-usb-external-hard-drive-must-read/
for example.

Moving to an SSD is just another SATA drive.  Nothing complex about that.
It is still just an internal SATA drive.

I think what you want to do simply isn't supported in windows.  I think
you are out of luck.

I used the virtual Win7 machine in VirtualBox a few times, but when I
tried to run Windows Update it told me that the hardware had changed
and I was running an unlicensed copy. It still runs, but with a nag
message every so often. Technically, it is still running on the same
hardware, just with an additional layer of abstraction.  Oh well.

I still have the orginal .VHD file, so I can fire up an old Win7 image
if I ever need to check something out, but that hardly ever happens.

That's very interesting.

Unfortunately, the #1 must-have feature is updating firmware.  The
machine is a new model and new firmware is likely.  Updating firmware
from a virtual machine seems likely to fail.

# LessCSS with Myles Braithwaite and a Round Table Q&A Session

*LessCSS*

LessCSS extends the CSS language to make it actually useable by adding
features like variables, mixins, functions, and a bunch of other
techniques that allow you to make your stylesheets more maintainable,
themeable, and extendible.

*Round Table Q&A Session*

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Kaiju
(384 Yonge Street).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members.

Ouch.

An alternative would be mounting a 2.5" SATA drive in the box.
Unfortunately that requires a proprietary cable that nobody seems to
be able to source.  Since there is quite a bit of demand, maybe it
will happen eventually.

Still another alternative would be to buy a replacement M.2 SSD and
install on that.  The plus is that I could buy a different size (the
original is 32M).  But M.2 drives are expensive, especially
considering the original box's cost and capabilities.

M.2 SSDs are also a bit confusing.  They come in different physical
sizes and install in spaces that may be limited.  They come in SATA
and PCI.e and so do the sockets, so you need to get that right.  PCI.e
is faster but more expensive.

Newegg.ca has or had a good price on a M.2 SATA 256G SSD but
- it was nearing the price of the whole box
- the specs didn't even give the physical length so I could not
  tell if it would fit.  Solvable if I cared enough.
- I hadn't figured out if the HP Stream Mini supports M.2 SATA

If it had a BASIC interpreter, it might have done better. And a power
supply that didn't catch fire ;).

The Datapoint 2200, which was originally intended to use the 8008, had a
BASIC interpreter.  I worked on those back in the mid '70s.  Also, there
was SCELBAL BASIC, from Scelbi Computing, for the 8008 (and later for
the 8080), which might have run on it.

Hey eveyrone!

I'm running Gnome 3.16 in Arch Linux. When I am working, I would like to be
able to shut off desktop notifications, preferably from the command line or
with a keyboard shortcut. I figure there must be a way to do this, but I
can't find a setting in gconf-settings or other likely places.

ANyone have hints?

thaks,

It had a one-line (plasma) display.  APL is definitely the right choice
if you can only see one line of a program at once.

Fairly crucial.

The article doesn't mention minicomputers.  They were in their hayday
when the MCM/70 came out.  Comparing it to mainframes is really
unfortunate.

The MCM/70 was an unbelievable proof-of-concept.  The 8008 was such a
miserable processor that it is astonishing that APL would fit.

The box was not Good Enough for me at the time.  But that doesn't veto
success: neither were the Altair 8080 nor the Apple II were good
enough, but the hunger was great enough that a market was created and
the products quickly evolved.  Too bad the MCM/70 didn't catch such a
wave.

(Altair power supplies were horrible too.  My Altair works because I
stuck an pop-can-sized capacitor from Active Surplus on it with
alligator clips (you can tell that I'm a software guy).)

No copies of York APL are known to exist.  I once had a listing that I
was using as scrap paper.  I couldn't find it by the time I found out
about this problem.

York's Zbigniew Stachniak (mentioned in the article) has a museum at York 
and hosted several interesting talks.  I haven't heard of any recently -- 
I've probably fallen off the mailing list.

Subject: [GTALUG] Ubuntu updates
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1504161446130.25014@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I'm annoyed at ubuntu's GUI Software Updates program.

Context: 14.04 LTS running on Acer Revo using proprietary nVidia drivers.

Normally I use apt-get update and upgrade to apply updates.  Today, right 
after I did that, the GUI thing told me that there were pending updates.  
So I told it to go ahead.

It proceeded to fail.  The Ubuntu crash reporter ground for a while (this 
is a first-generation Atom processor) and then said the bug was known:

<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-331/+bug/1268257>

Look at how long that has been around.  Look at how many people
(systems) are listed as affected.  Look how many duplicates of this
bug are filed.

I don't want to waste the time investigating, but it is suspicious to
me that apt-get had no problem.

I remain quite skeptical of Unbuntu's and Fedora's GUI software
updaters.

I've often said the IMSAI 8080 was a better quality clone of the
Altari.  My IMSAI had a power supply that was almost powerful enough to
use for arc welding.  ;-)

I asked on the #docs IRC channel and Alexandre Franke supplied this answer:

First of all, dconf and gsettings replaced gconf.

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.notifications enable true
(and obviously it's enable false to have them disabled)

Source: the GNOME control center source code.

Fascinating stuff. Thanks for the pointer.

One of the unsung heroes of those early computers were the oscilloscopes
that had to be developed to look at the pulse timing. You see lots of the
early scopes in the photographs.

One of the things mentioned, but not described was the "Williams tube",
which was a type of memory based on  a CRT, with the phosphor decay time
being used for storage.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_tube

They also mentioned delay lines.  I used to work on some video terminals
that used a delay line, though a coil of wire was used instead of mercury.

Incidentally, I aslo used to work on an ancient "Teleregister" computer,
located in the basement of the old stock exchange building at 234 Bay
St.  It was a single purpose computer, as was common back then, which
was used to transmit stock prices to brokers offices.  It was built with
vacuum tubes & relays and had a memory drum.  I recall gapping the
heads, with a piece of bond paper, between the head and drum.  That
system was older than I was.

The "enable" key no longer seems to be available in
org.gnome.desktop.notifications anymore:

 ~  gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.desktop.notifications
org.gnome.desktop.notifications application-children
['gnome-network-panel', 'dropbox', 'rhythmbox', 'vlc', 'deluge', 'skype',
'guake', 'sylpheed', 'window-58', 'nautilus', 'calibre-gui', 'chromium',
'clipit', 'empathy', 'evolution', 'nemo', 'emacs', 'pidgin', 'nm-applet',
'firefox-developer-edition', 'thunderbird', 'gnome-music']
org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-in-lock-screen true
org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners false

--------------------

so, I tried
?  ~  gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners false

that seems to have worked, though I still hear the audio notification.  I
will keep playing around and report back if I find a fully workking
solution.  Can you also point me to the IRC channel you were using? I might
try asking there if I can't understand how to fix this.

Hi Matt,

I asked in the #docs channel on GIMPNet (I'm on the docs team). You
could also try #gnome-shell.

Interesting article about the ZFS filesystem... In the past I have
defaulted to the usual ext(2,3,4) but the ability to make filesystem
snapshots and rollbacks would be useful:

Yeah, looks like a great phone. But they don?t sell it to Brazil. :/

Perhaps after arriving in Canada/Toronto around November. ;]

I've been intensely phone shopping for a little while, and have been as
unimpressed with the company as I have been impressed with the phone.
Despite a really good piece of launch hardware, there are some substantial
flaws in the phone but even more -- and far worse -- with the company.

GTALUGgers (and others) trying to buy the phone in 2015 may have noticed
that OnePlus, without warning or explanation, stopped shipping to Canada,
and only started again last week. The company was not at all forthcoming in
any rationale and offered nothing but cheery weeks-long promises of Real
Soon Now.

After researching on the forums, it appears to me that the company had lied
about the phone's value (declaring them at $99) which eventually got
shipments red-flagged by Canada customs. This, in combination with the
historically miserable service and extra fees of DHL (the only Canadian
shipping option) led to indefinite suspension of Canadian shipping of the
OnePlus. Things re-opened this week, with UPS as the courier and taxes
pre-collected at purchase time.

But that's not the worst of it IMO. The company was caught completely
flat-footed when Cyanogen went commercial, pulled the rug out from OnePlus,
and signed an exclusive deal in India with a competing handset maker. This
has thrown software efforts into a panic as OnePlus now unexpectedly finds
itself having to rush-release its own Android mutation, OxygenOS. So now
the the OnePlus software support, once thought of as super stable, is not.
Those who have lots of time on their hands researching and installing ROMs
should be OK, the mainstream will suffer through this transition as we
witness one more Android fragmentation. Whoever is in charge of OnePlus's
corporate partnerships should be long fired by now, yet no such penance is
in hand.

And then you have a number of production and marketing choices that seem
just insane. The OnePlus is the only phone in its field that claims to be a
"global" phone, yet lacks LTE Band 20 which is critical for Europe. Its
wifi doesn't do 802.11ac. The invite system has longer overstayed its
novelty. And you can't buy one in Australia or Switzerland or Brazil at any
price. Their e-commerce capabilities are weaker than those of hawkers of
dollar gadgets on eBay.

Add to this the fact that the field of
"near-flagship-features-at-midrange-prices" smartphones is about to get
very crowded, and some of the other vendors have the benefit of retail
access (instant availability) and local warranty support. Within the next
month or two, don't consider the OnePlus without also having a look at the
Asus Zenfone 2 with 4GB RAM, the Huawei P8 and the 2nd-generation Moto G.
More intrepid shoppers will find even greater choice from domestic Chinese
vendors such as Xiaomi and LeTV.

So, while I badly need to replace my phone right now, I'm passing on the
OnePlus One. The many poor decisions have me seriously (but maybe I'm the
only one) concerned about the company's long-term stability. Its corporate
management is just AWFUL, glossed over by a thin veneer of social media
cheerleading.

Still they do make well-built phones on low margins. If the OnePlus Two
offers any evidence that the company has learned its lessons I may still
come on-board, while I have a look at the reviews of the Asus and Huawei
phones as they are released. The competition is coming, the bar is rising
and many good options are at hand.

Interesting machine. The choice of APL limited their audience and with

I paid HST on the full price of the phone when I got it in January.

Canada Post was another option but I didn't take it because there didn't
seem to be any way of tracking the shipment and I didn't want to take
the chance of the shipment getting "lost" along the way. Even with the
DHL fees, this phone was still great value for money.

This has been a non-issue for me. I don't see any compelling reason for
me to move away from the installed Cyanogen to OxygenOS. The phone does
everything I expect of it and more so I'm blissfully ignorant of what I
might be missing.

Both non-issues for me, though it would be if I travelled to Europe.

> The invite system has longer overstayed its novelty.

This was the reason that kept me from buying one for months until I
finally gave up resisting it and jumped through the hoops to get an
invite. As much as the invite system was touted as "innovative", it
wasn't. It was just an annoyance and added friction to the purchasing
process, neither of which are great things if you want to maximize sales.

Being a WIND Mobile customer has its challenges, the biggest being that
I can't buy any phone and expect it to work on their network. It's very
time-consuming to dig up information on whether a given phone will work
on that network or not, especially for phones from the myriad of
domestic Chinese vendors.

This has been an amazing phone but I don't have much to compare it to. I
let a friend who was interested in it play with it and he was amazed at
how responsive it is. The only concern I have about it is how repairable
it would be in the event of screen breakage or other damage. My son put
his HTC One M7 through the wash in his jeans and took it in to get it
repaired. Three repair shops told him the same thing, "Those phones are
not repairable because of the way they're assembled." I just read that
the M9 received the lowest rating possible for repairability. I'd rather
not treat these as disposable devices, though that seems to be the
direction all smart phones are going. I have no idea how repairable the
OPO is so that is something I will be looking for the next time I buy a
phone.

?You may not have a choice if you want to stay supported. The official ROM
is now Oxygen, eventually Cyanogen support will be dropped and it will
become just another third-party ROM.?

?phonearena and gsmarena are both good sources of which phones do what

?Not disposable, but not far from. Clearly phones aren't designed to
outlast three year contracts. All the more reason why flagships are lagging
in sales and the hottest part of the market is now the high-value-midrange.
It's a field that the OPO has occupied alone for a long time, but not much
longer.

No problems with three videos from the "latest videos" page. Ubuntu
14.04, Firefox 37.0.1.

If you provide a link to a specific video, I can try it.

Running Arch Linux + Firefox  37.0.2 to watch video at this link:

https://www.thestar.com/life/sourced/2015/04/08/carls-jrs-queen-west-location-has-a-dedicated-milkshake-bar-sourced.html

I needed to temporarily disable the HTTPS-Everywhere plugin... after
restarting and using 'http' links the videos played OK.

Chrome 42.0.2311.90 with no plugins played the videos OK.

It was HTTPS Everyware that caused the problem.  I disabled thestar.com
in it, so I'm past that problem.  That only leaves the videos that won't
play for other reasons.  ;-)

https://www.thestar.com/life/sourced/2015/04/08/carls-jrs-queen-west-location-has-a-dedicated-milkshake-bar-sourced.html

difference.  I wasn't able to see any video until I went to the "http"
(non-secure) version of the page and then it worked.

I'm using Chrome, Ubuntu 14.04, and Adobe Flash.

I've been using VirtualBox a lot recently, and I've been pretty
impressed with it - running more than one simultaneous machine,
setting up an internal network and running ansible between them,
nifty.  Today at work we had an interesting discussion about Digital
Ocean: the suggestion was made (and undoubtedly it's obvious to many
on this list, but it was eye-opening to me, I'm still getting my head
around disposable machines) that if you weren't sure an upgrade to a
droplet would work, just clone it, do the upgrade on the clone and see
how it goes.  Then you can make your decision and destroy the unwanted
version.  All of which made me think "wouldn't it be cool if I could
have a system with an totally stripped Linux with VirtualBox as the
"Window Manager" so I could toggle between two or three running OSes
with graphical interfaces ..."  So:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization_implementations

I've already ruled out OpenVZ as it looks like all virtualized systems
have to use the same kernel.  Xen seems like the optimal method, but I
seem to remember that your processor specifically has to support
virtualization ("lscpu" says, among other things, "Virtualization:
VT-x", so I'm covered?)

Assuming I want the base OS (does that term even apply?) to be Linux,
and I don't like proprietary software, what's the "best choice" if I
want to simultaneously run things like Debian Jessie, TinyCore,
SliTaz, and possibly even Windows 7?

Links to good tutorials and "Getting Started" guides would also be
very much appreciated.

FWIW, I have VirtualBox on my openSUSE 13.1 notebook.  I have installed
VMs for Windows 10, Windows 98 and OS/2 Warp 4.  I can switch among them
and back to Linux.  The VMs run full screen and to look at them, you
wouldn't know you were in a VM.

On my desktop system, I have Windows 7 & 10 in VMs.

I've not tried it yet (it's on my todo list) but you might have a look
at Qubes OS.  May not be exactly what you're looking for but it's the
closest that I can think of (aside from VirtualBox et al).  If it's
possible to run docker (perhaps via subuser)* under Qubes, you might
be able to have your cake and eat it too.

On Solaris, we did tons with very-lightweight VMs, using code for 
security isolation that could create "containers" that looked just like 
machines.

The only limitation was the common OS version, and you could be ahead of 
the evrsion in userspace stuff like shared libraries.  We rarely found 
cases where we wanted a different OS, just some where we wanted to 
emulate an older one.

You may want to check out Proxmox, i use it for the cloud as VM env., it is
amazing!, not sure how it would work
however on strictly a desktop environment. It is free, even though it bugs
you to sign up for support.

It is a neat trick.

But what is it useful for?

Clearly it is great to be able to run different OSes if you need to
run more than one.  For example, to be able to run MS Word when you
mostly want to run Linux.  Or to test on multiple platforms.

In the Libreswan project, we use virtualization to test networking 
software.  Since some of the code is in the OS, we at least sometimes have 
to run different OSes.

But most of virtualization seems to be for other purposes.

Yeah, that (sadly) is a good use case.  But surely a proper package
management system would let you do this too.

- allow more than one version of a package to be installed

- allow more than one instance of the same package, but with different 
  global configuration.  Perhaps global configuration is evil.

- allow package dependencies to contol which versions of each package
  talk to each other.  For example, if A talks to B, under some
  conditions, old A should talk to old B

- make sure that distinct package's configurations don't affect each
  other.  Example: two different packages that use Apache; they should not
  configure Apache in ways that conflict.

- job migration between machines, even while running, seems useful.
  (That's not a package management problem.)

One step more towards virtualization:

Jails are minimal and may be good enough but a lot cheaper than
supporting true virtual x86 machines.

I think that Serious VMware products are stripped Linux systems that
can run VMs without a lot of extras.

I think that Zen Dom0 (host) can be minimal too.

So much of the noise this day is about things like Docker and CoreOS.
A lot feels like branding exercises rather than technology.  I find it
too hard to figure out what they actually are.

I think Red Hat's software collections are supposed to do that:

NixOS addresses quite a few of these. Each version of a package is built
into its own unique prefixed environment, and each build can have its
own env variables set. You're free to switch between versions on your
system as well.

Essentially it is a distro that is built using pointers to individual
packages' git commit ids.

Cheers, Jamon

Replying to myself - that part isn't accurate. The package manager deals
with where the upstream source is found. http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/

Hi all: Just want to remind you of the Toronto Release Party tomorrow
(Thursday) night.  The party has expanded in scope, and we're now
officially celebrating the Ubuntu 15.04 "Vivid Vervet" release, the
Debian 8 "Jessie" release (in anticipation of the actual release on
Saturday the 25th), and some of us are still celebrating Linux Mint
LMDE 2.0 "Betsy", released on 10 April.

Debian "Jessie" release party announcment:
https://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyJessie#ReleasePartyJessie.2FCanada.2FToronto.Canada:_Toronto

Come join us at Alio Restaurant at 8:00pm -- Mike is supplying the
coffee and cupcakes!
