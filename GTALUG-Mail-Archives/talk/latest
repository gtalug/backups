I got one of these on sale, but even now the price is $170 which is not a
bad deal at all.

The notebook, is very thin, light and surprisingly not bad, the keyboard is
not as good as on thinkpads, but could be much, much worse. Beware that
here are no PgUp, PgDown, Home, Ins, Del keys so after some remapping ALT +
Cursor keys work.
Also on top row F-keys labelled weirdly as in chromium-specific function
keys but are in fact F1-F10. POWER button is where F11 was supposed to be.
POWER key works most of the time, hard reset button is F3+POWER.
There is left `Super` key, which is something in between of Fn and 'Windows
logo' key, but it's located where 'Caps Lock' is on regular keyboard.

When I got the chromebook it was configured for an organization 'enrollment
program', it took some googling to figure out how to set that back to
regular settings. After logging in with my gmail credentials and finding
ChromeOS to be sleek but somewhat useless, I claimed my free 1TB of Google
drive storage (* Free for 2 years) and decided to install Debian, giving it
full computing resources and not messing around with crouton.

Removing ChromeOS involves undoing 7 screws on the bottom and removing BIOS
write-protect screw, then pressing Ctrl+D during boot turns chromebook into
regular laptop with SeaBios.
Wifi card is atheros-something, but it's not the best card and seems to be
a little finicky on some wireless networks, the biggest annoyance -- you
need to add a script that unloads the drivers before laptop falls asleep,
otherwise screen will lockup on wakeup. I haven't tried using bluetooth yet.
After getting rid of everything chrome-related the hardware seems to be
pretty open, this laptop might even be a new candidate computer for RMS.

I ended up with vanilla Debian Jessie and KDE (kde-plasma-netbook, which is
really stock KDE but with some netbook-specific UI tweaks).
I had to install Wheezy first as 3.16 kernel in Jessie would not boot, and
then I had to install 3.17 as it's the first linux version that supports
touchpad. Touchpad hardware is pretty awkward, but it does support
multitouch and has a middle mouse button when you press on the middle of it
with three fingers.

I needed to do lots of tweaking to get everything working, but in the end
it is a pretty sweet laptop.
If I were installing the OS from scratch again, I would have gone with
Chrubuntu.

Battery life is pretty good -- I ran about 3+ hours without
laptop-mode-tools/cpufreq-utils and 6+ hours with. At that point I still
had about 3 hours battery left, I just didn't need to run the laptop any
more.
With 20% screen brightness, powertop shows ~4W on idle, ~11W playing 720p
video off youtube (with wireless card using about ~6W).

There's 2GB of Ram soldered onto the board and not upgradable, storage
however is, it's an 16GB M.2 card. The laptop has an SD slot, but SD card
sticks about half way out so it's impractical to go with one as a permanent
storage. I'm going to upgrade to a 128GB one but M.2 is a relatively new
standard, in the US it is $12 cheaper even after currency conversion.

I checked the 4-pin aux connector that is connected to the MB and it seems 
within spec. The power supply lines aren't easy to access but I can test 
them. I wouldn't expect a failure of the power supply as I haven't had it 
long and it is one that has a wattage rating about twice that of the 
original. Power supply failures I've had in the past have usually been ones 
where the fan bearings wore out.

I have swapped the CPU for one that was supposed to be a good one and no 
change. I have built myself a simple ESR meter. After I pull the MB out of 
the case I will be able to check the caps ane see if one of them failed.

Message-ID: <CAGc8pF4sx8P4214sGmRZV78qO7+9qkkvisKxv7SfWkM2X-GoYA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using Unetbootin to do a netinstall of Debian.

It says there are no compatible kernel modules on any of the mirrors when I
try anything but Stable.

Obviously I know I can just install Stable and then do an upgrade, but
still.

What's up with this?

To install testing or unstable you have to use the development version
of the net installer.

Go here:

https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/

You could try the Beta2 jessie installer, or the weekly snapshot build
or the daily snapshot build.

According to <http://gtalug.org/> :

"GTALUG is currently looking for speakers for the 9th December, 2014 
meeting. If you are interested in speaking please contact our talks 
coordinator."

Let's brainstorm on this.  Here's a poorly organized dump of some of my 
thoughts.

- I'd love to hear Lennart talk about what he's learned working on
  routers.

- I'd like to learn what each of you has learned using Linux (or
  perhaps, not able to do using Linux) and what your current
  Linux-related interests are.

- I'd like to hear how people have set up their internet gatways.
  What's worth doing, what's easy, what's hard.
  (It's time for me to revisit this after having a pretty static
  setup for a decade.  I'd be willing to talk about what I've done
  but it is pretty stale.)

- I'm interested in setting up my in-house services like a cloud.
  Perhaps <http://owncloud.org/>.  Motivation: I want to keep control
  of my own data as much as possible.  Can anyone speak to this?

- Subproblem of above: I run MediaWiki already.  Tips and tricks (eg.
  from Drew) about care, feeding, and use would be welcome.

- I'd be willing to share 10 minutes worth of what I've learned about 
  little Windows gadgets as Linux platforms.

- I'd love to discuss whether this is interesting and useful
  <http://www.banana-pi.com/eacp_view.asp?id=64>

  This is a version of the Banana Pi with an added ethernet switch:
  5 x 1G eithernet ports.

  The Banana Pi is intended to mimic the Raspberry Pi in some ways but
  with a stronger processor; my impression has been that this is goofy
  and that the Cubieboard2 and Cubietruck <http://cubieboard.org/>
  were more transparent uses of the Allwinner chips.

  But gluing on a switch seems very attractive.

- chatting about peoples' workflow always seems useful: it's not just
  the tools, its how we use them, how we find them useful, and where
  they don't quite meet expectations.

  Examples: backup methodology, distro update methodology, favourite
  editor (leave out tribalism), programming language, etc.

- why Go is interesting <https://golang.org/>.
  Why Rust is interesting <http://www.rust-lang.org/>.
  Why Python 2.x still has a loyal following.

- what are you doing with your _____?  Example: Raspberry Pi.

- How you make your mobile device work with your desktop?

Summary: we've had Question and Answer sessions, how about an Answer
and Question session?  By that I meen: people give a mini-chat about
something they think is interesting and have the rest of us ask
questions in response.

Okay that's cool. There don't appear to be any USB images but if I recall
Unetbootin can write an ISO to USB.

Many thanks!

Hmmm, wait, could I use that to install the armhf version of Debian on my
Cubox?

DevOps - Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible in particular.

The only use I'd have for something like the Raspberry Pi is as a router
and with only one Ethernet port, that disqualifies it. The two devices
you mention above are interesting because they have multiple Ethernet
ports and would be viable replacements for my ancient and I presume
power-hungry P2/350 Compaq that has been running for the last 10 years
as my Internet gateway/firewall.

Python 2.x is still popular because many Python modules/projects haven't
been ported to Python 3.x. That's changing. Go and Rust aren't even on
my radar. Dart, maybe. Typescript seems like a safer bet. ECMAScript 6
looks very interesting. Within very few years, it will no longer be
feasible to do anything useful with a browser without Javascript
enabled. Javascript is what is enabling rich-client applications,
particularly for mobile devices.

I don't and that is something I'd like to rectify.

Finding enough time to admin a MediaWiki site to get a balance between
swatting away spammers and locking it down to unusability would get my
vote.

So, a "You're doing it wrong!" session? Nice idea.

Debian images are generally hybrid and can be dd'd to a USB stick directly

How many hours do you have?

Or Anthony could talk about all the legacy sysadmin disasters of mine

Take a good look at ikiwiki; it's a lot simpler, keeps history in git,
and you can edit pages in your favourite editor, commit them, and see
them show up formatted.

Nor I.

I had been parking at Yorkdale for the trip downtown, but then the TTC
parking there got closed for renovation shortly after our meetings moved
away from the Spadina line.  Will have to come up with a revised plan.

Maven and a Round Table Q&A Session
===================================

Maven
-----

Make was written to avoid the problem of recompiling files
that hadn't changed. It of course introduced a new set of
problems , such as verbosity, and the solutions for them.
Those solutions in turn introduced another set of problems
such as redundancy, and so on. Maven is one of the
moderately successful attempts to solve most of them.

Round Table Q&A Session
-----------------------

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from
the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to
answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a
great way to meet fellow members of our community and
discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

## Schedule

* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting (at 9:00 pm) a group of
GTALUGers move to the The Imperial Pub 54 Dundas St East
for refreshments and more socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new
ideas, improve every process every year, and foster
collaboration between individuals with differing needs,
interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek
participation from those who enhance it. This code of
conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to
mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice
that could jeopardize the participation of any person in
the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in
private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our
actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who
represents the community officially or informally, claims
affiliation, or participates directly. It applies to
activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the
GTALUG Code of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG
Board Members.

Yeah probably better that way.  Although I am sure some of it could be
very educational and entertaining.

For some reason I am still running stock firmware on my DIR-825.
Of course by forwarding ssh and http to somewhere else inside I haven't
really needed it to do anything complicated.

Well Debian's kernels are not built to run on the Cubox, so it would

TTC has a good guide to commuter parking here:
<https://www.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/Parking/index.jsp>. I have heard
good things about York Mills station (but as a pedestrian I don't have
that much information about cars).

I could happily speak to this in the future.

I'm self-hosting a bunch of stuff at home, as part of my own degooglification
process: ownCloud, SOGo, Snowy, Mediagoblin, Tiny Tiny RSS, Dokuwiki... in the
past, MythTV (including Mythweb), Mediawiki, Ampache... and services I'm
hosting, but not at home, include FreeSWITCH and ejabberd (and email...).

I also gave a talk at FSOSS this year on software freedom in a networked work,
which covered some of this as well, though not as a technical talk.

That's certainly interesting.

We had a series of talks over the years on virtualization which kind of got
boring in that it amounted to "so, how do we go through the mechanics of
setting a VM to install X"?

We had a talk on Bosh recently, which represents a newer way of going
through those mechanics.  Interesting in that it has gotten easier.
(I gather that Docker tries hard at another take on "making it easier")

The OTHER side of this is managing the infrastructure for a set of VMs.
I'm not keen on something where that's a big job; it sure would be nice if
most of the time spent managing a dozen services is spent on those
dozen services.

I know VMWare sells a product, vSphere, targeted at this, and that
OpenStack does somewhat similar (in OSS arena).  Would like to hear
more...

Most of the time this Teksaavy connection is fine, but on occasion it
slows to the point of being unusable. Can anyone suggest a program that
will log connection speed? A scrolling graph and ascii record would be
perfect.

There are lots of programs listed in response to a Google search, such as
this one:
http://dynacont.net/documentation/linux/network_monitoring/

But it would greatly help to hear what others in this group recommend.
I'm running Linux Mint.

Thanks -

for lots of "standard" thing to examine cacti is good.

Connection speed to where though?

You would have to do something that talks to a system somewhere else and
measures the current speed between those two places.  Hopefully you can
pick something where your connection locally is the slowest link and
hence the one measured.

Well, I did a "delayroute" awk script that used traceroute: a similar 
approach that turned its frequency of probing up when things fell below 
some normal value would do nicely, and tell tek where the problem was as 
seen from your site.

This is quite a bargain.  3840 x 2160 pixels!  Not a great monitor (TN, 
not IPS; 30Hz), but still perhaps useful.

We can buy it cheaper: US price was US$299 but ours is C$299.

They've always been more successful at hardware: things like the Z80

this.  Shame about their attempts to diversify into software, really.

Too bad the video handling hardware in it is so awful (100ms to process
the data before displaying it?  Ouch).  It is effectively at best 10Hz. I
think trying to use a mouse with that screen would drive you crazy.
If you are just displaying a lot of text then it is probably fine.

This is actually a Dell monitor that the Microsoft Store is selling.

Microsoft's Surface seems nice enough after the 3rd attempt.  But I
still think that a clamshell is a better format than a tablet +
keyboard.

Remember that Xenix was originally from them.  I wonder what the
landscape would be like if Microsoft had gone with it instead of
NT (there was internal discussion of that).  It might not have been
good for us given their controlling nature.

Well certainly Debian has no issue installing both python 2 and 3 at
the same time and has done so for quite a while.  Next release appears
to have 2.7 and 3.4 installed.

It is rather annoying when languages stop supporting existing working
code.  To me that pretty much means the language is immature and perhaps
even badly managed.  Not that that has ever stopped a language from
becoming popular.

Mailman does have a way of moderate all HTML messages.

But there are a couple of reasons this might be a bad idea:

1) Some smartphone email applications don't allow to send messages as
plain text.

2) We would have to help people configure their email clients to send
plain text emails.

If your solution to #2 is they can just Google it, you could also
Google how to read HTML email in your email client.

I don't have a problem reading HTML email and often send it.  However,
for this and other lists, I have my address list configured to allow
plain text only.

My understanding of the reasons for not using HTML are bandwidth &
storage, though this might not be so critical these days and security. 
It's hard to put hazards in plain text.

Apologies, I forgot to force it to plain text. I am on a blackberry Z10 that I despise and it don't allow me to default to plain text which is my wish. I have to flip it every time I am writing a mail.

I will make certain not to overlook it again

"were to take place" is too strong.  I put forward some ideas to try
to make an empty spot more interesting (in no official capacity!).  It
turned out that the spot wasn't empty.  That's a good thing.

What was empty was the meeting announcement on the web page.  Not so
good.

I'm not much of a Python user.  I'm certainly not too aware of things
in its ecosystem.

I think that it is good that language powers-that-be consider
incompatible updates.  Otherwise mistakes are with us forever.  They
should be infrequent and probably batched.

It helps a lot if the incompatibility can be mechanically cleansed.
Second best: mechanically detected statically.  Third best:
mechanically detected dynamically.  Horrible: just behaving different
at runtime.

At some point, the community has to go cold turkey.  No new work on
libraries etc. for the old thing.  It's like taking off a bandaid: net
pain is less if the transition is quick.  Of course some kind of
synchronization would be useful.  What better use of a BDFL.

RHEL5 and RHEL6 have very long support cycles.  It is unreasonable to
claim those as requirements.  In fact, they are designed to be stable.
Doing new development on and for them is kind of a contradiction.
OK, I admit that until 7.1 is out, maybe 6 can be defended.

Fedora 20 seems to have Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.2.
Centos 6.6 only has python 2.6.6
Centos 5.11 only has Python 2.4.3

This speaks to how much RHEL values stability.

Perhaps Python routinely and frequently breaks compatibility and
that's why these old versions hang around.

BTW I consider the stability of RHEL (or Windows) a bit of a problem.
Perhaps our way out is virtual machines or containerization.  They
change coupling.  I don't really like that.

There are so many language mistakes frozen in amber.

How long did C keep "int" is the default type if you neglect to
mention a type in a declaration?  This should have been a compile-time
diagnosed error decades ago.

How long did FORTRAN allow undeclared variables?

I don't understand what's so hard about the Python 2 => 3 transition.
Is it too big a step?  Are there not enough attractions?  Is the first 
step a lulu[1]?

I do not intend to make a habit of it, but the question actually seemed

Well that does seem to be mostly the case with python 3.

I am still very very very disappointed that they did NOT remove the
broken and essentially useless lambda support so that they could some
day replace it with a working one.

Python likes to make it seem like you can do functional (rather than
procedural) code in it, and then when you try it goes "ha ha, fooled you".

Well as long as they make it easy to keep around an older version for
handling old code.

It is rather unreasonable how some people insist on stability above all
else, which means not changing things, and then at the same time complain
that new features are missing.

But you saved 4 bytes of code each time you didn't specify.  Think of
the bytes saved.

I think a lot of people rely on libraries for python, and until those
are converted to work with the new version, people can't move their own
code to the new version.

It can't.  At least not in a way that I can reply to cleanly in plain
text.

So unless people don't expect replies to their email, they better not
send them in html in the first place.  So you may as well just block
them and let the user know why it was blocked.

There may be no other option. Also, many clients hide or fudge the
status. For instance, Gmail is currently claiming that it's going to
send this as plain text with no extraneous quoting. Will it do this? I
won't know until I send it.

For all its faults, Mozilla Thunderbird can quote HTML to plain text
quite well. But I'm sure there are many ways to mess up a reply to a
plain text message by quoting in the standard way. That which passes
for plain text is a minefield of assumptions (Your English Must Only
Have 26 Characters, and Criminally Limited Punctuation) leading to
na?ve "markup free" limited solutions like Markdown.

Unfortunately, if you're going to block replies based on e-mail
format, you'll get a dwindling number of participants in the mailing
list. And nothing kills off user groups like lack of participation.

It also for the longest time would not actually put '>' on the lines of
the plain text if you asked it to send both html and plain text versions.
Not sure that bug has ever been fixed.

And it is hardly a useful email client when you do email over ssh.
I use mutt and edit with vim.

I will happily ignore html messages and not reply to them.

Get a better mail client or configure it properly. I only check my email
in a terminal and don't really have problems reading or replying to HTML
mail.

Yes, I do prefer text, but realize there are a lot of mailing lists that
only send HTML and clients/devices that make it difficult for the user
to write plain text mail. 

It's much easier to configure your client properly than to get everyone
to stop using HTML email (which will never happen).

For me it has always been a very simple logical request. There is no
benefit at all to using HTML in this list, and there are tons and tons of
drawbacks to using it.

GMail and now even Inbox seem to always default to plain text for me
anyway, at least AFAICT.

Well if you apply such all or nothing thinking, you can dismiss almost any
standard or rule. Why bother if not everyone will obey? Of course not
everyone will obey every rule but they are still useful and this one is
very reasonable to ask.

That makes Centos 6.6 and 5.11 pretty much useless for deploying modern
Django web applications if we're to rely solely on the distro-supplied
Python. Fortunately, there is a relatively easy way to work around that
also addresses the Python 2 vs Python 3 issue. We only deploy Python
applications using virtualenv
<https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html>, which
"is a tool to create isolated Python environments". We can deploy any
version of Python we want in that virtualenv and it will be completely
isolated from the system-wide Python. This is useful not just for
dealing with Python version issues but also library version issues. For
instance, we have multiple versions of Django deployed for projects of
various vintage. If we relied on the distro-supplied Django package,
we'd have to upgrade every Django project at the same time or dedicate a
machine, real or virtual, for each Django version, neither of which are
viable options.

The claim that deploying Python 2 and Python 3 on the same machine is a
"non-starter" points to a fundamental lack of understanding of how
Python applications are actually deployed. This is really much ado about
nothing.

Hey sorry to bug you, I am unemployed again and in dire need of a project
:-)

If you have that image or if you know a way I could generate my own, I
tried searching but everything now is about the Cubox-i.

Solidrun might have an original image but I would really like to have
Debian armhf which is I assume what you have installed?

Thanks!

That one's fixed, though there's a lot not to like still in Thunderbird.
Like its weird text-size bump in some rich text modes. Or it not
understanding that CSS from embedded replies doesn't need spell-checked.
Thunderbird development is stalled, so the best I can hope for is that they
don't add any new bugs.

My sincerest condolences ;-)

If you've got reams of mission-critical legacy code written in the
previous version of a language, whether FORTRAN IV or original K&R C or
Perl 4 or whatever other deprecated tongue was spoken by the coders of
yore, a new system that's going to not run that code or misreinterpret it
in interestingly broken ways is _NOT_ going to be your friend (or be of
any immediate practical use in production).

You do need room to introduce new languages, or improved dialects of
existing ones, but there does need to be a way for the versions to
coexist, so your Perl 4, 5, and 6 code each go to their own interpreter,
or GCC can be flagged to parse according to a particular C standard,
and all your old code keeps on happily working.  You cannot go and
rewrite or mechanically-recode or even recompile everything on some
flag day and have perfectly-refactored new code running bug-free by
sunset.

And if some language's BFDL and TPTB decide that the new version is going
to break old code and not support compatibility, the wise coder having to
refactor that codebase goes to a different language entirely because that
bunch are likely to break everything again next time they have a better
idea, and the time after that too.

There is room for code-refactoring projects, if new features make the
code more maintainable (as if! See also: "technical debt" and having to
QA everything again), but they have to run on the downstream timeline and
not be dictated by upstream releasing their whizzy new compiler.

Ideally there's some legacy maintenance on libraries and such, but
there are advantages to a *stable* language where someone isn't
going to tweak the meaning or precedence of something or add a new
reserved keyword or whatever else might change the meaning of some
million-line system that someone doesn't want to refactor.

A compiler running in default mode can't ever reject something that was
once a valid program, but undefined variables IMHO were always something
that dismerited a warning; maybe declaring the code to be pre-good-taste
could silence the warnings, while a later language revision requiring
proper declarations could make that an error if that mode is declared.

I've done a wee bit of Python, but not tracking it too closely.  There
are too many languages!

I miss the days when knowing C, shell, and awk would cover all you needed
for Unix utilities.  It seems that nowadays, diving into the source of
some random Linux package that needs something checked or tweaked, every
other time one finds that yet another different language was used; it's
the Tower Of Babel story all over, or if not that then the coding style
is something, ahhh, *unique*.

It's good that language-design research is still happening, and new
languages are getting road-tested, but there's just not the mindspace
for any of us to simultanously master them all, and by the time you
try there will be another three or so to learn.  I'm almost cheering for
evolutionary pressure to cross a few of them off the list!

Well, because there will always be people doing stupid things like
sending html mails, not quoting replies properly, not stripping
footers/signatures, and such. You do you best to help educate people but
don't cut them off lock-stock-and-barrel unless they show a real sign of
stubborn ignorance. Then there's the fact that I have better things to
do than to educate the world. Fighting the grave injustices of html
email is just not that important to me. I have other priorities in life.

I hear you! I'm learning Javascript and wondering, "How did this
language become so ubiquitous? Why doesn't Python run in browsers? It's
a great language for embeddable scripting."

Thomas... you realize that both the emails you sent to the list on the subject of not using HTML
email... were HTML emails... right?

I'm not sure if that was intentional satire... :)

(No, Gmail is not sending plain text email.)

I think that's more the problem. Gmail sometimes shows an indicator that
it's using plain text, but then sends it with an HTML version anyway. It
being Google, there are no reliable user settings we can control.

I still occasionally use a system that transmits and receives using
5-bit Baudot, but I don't recommend it. The slightest bit of noise can
shift you out of alphabetical characters into others. Plus, it has no case.

Same with ASCII though, really.  It has upper and lower, but there is no
Business Case for it.

OH HOW EMBARRASSING

Anyway it's not GMail's fault it's mine.

I've been using Inbox, the hip new thing from Google. I assumed since
Lennart was not scolding me I was okay :-)

See http://www.brython.info for an implementation of Python in JS in the

The industry seems to like converters (i.e. GWT, Pygamas, etc.) and
not replacing JavaScript with projects like IronMonkey. Which is kind
of interesting considering there is a huge user base of Python
programmers who are coding on top of Microsoft's Excel (instead of
having to use VB.NET and C#).

CoffeeScript has a Python like syntax (I'm loosely using the word
'like') if you are interested in not having to write JavaScript. But
it compiles CoffeeScript into JavaScript so it's not the best thing in
the world.

It still lives on - in an admitted niche - in amateur radio teletype
digital modes. Because RTTY uses a very simple FSK coding scheme, it
survives amplification from nonlinear amplifiers quite well. It means you
get teeth-rattlingly loud signals blasting in from stations worldwide.
Usually all over your carefully crafted low power signal ... grar.

Interesting toy but not something I'd rely on to build a serious
application right now. For better or worse, AngularJS has huge critical
mass and that's where we've cast our lot.

Is there really a need to moderate long-time members of this mailing

I'd looked at Pyjamas and I was never convinced of its merits. Like
Brython that Jamon pointed out, it occurred to me as an interesting toy
but not something I'd bet the farm on.

I don't see the point of CoffeeScript. It removes curly braces and some
other constructs at the expense of reducing the number of people who can
actually read the code I write.

But the cubox has eSATA and a box.  And some of us already have them
and have had them for a while.

But that is a very nice board.

  Reminds me of a post on Slashdot about Google's development process,
that was so good, I saved it locally...

That's so last decade.

Is this meant to be funny? It seems like a pretty good effort at offending
anyone who isn't an old conformist middle class douchebag.

FYI... I was trying out my new ODROID-U3 with 16GB Adata microSD,
    http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=11_1216_175_177&item_id=058665
I was actually looking for 8GB one, but they were out of it.

Adata specs says
    - 10MB/s write -- I got 13MB/s, so it's in the ballpark.
    - 30MB/s read -- I got 80MB/s.  It may go higher, but probably
      limited by my card reader.  It's rare to see something above
      published specs.

You were sending both plain text and html, which means I get plain text
version automatically and hence am entirely happy.  The html version I
don't look at doesn't bother me.  It is html only email that sucks.

Oh I get it. Weird "transient gender" people with shaved heads and

  I apologize to anyone who was offended.  It was intended as a dig
against Google's seemingly capricious imlementation and deprecation of
their software.

GTALUG operates under a code of conduct.  

http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/  

The code has some leeway it so that if certain kinds of comments or material appear, recognition and an apology are an absolutely perfect outcome (and this thread is a good example of that).

If anyone has feedback on the code, let me know.   I can always use more input.  Proposed revisions are reviewed annually by the board.

It's not good for the group if we ignore offensive comments.

Also:

>>> 2**100

Compare with:

If Netscape 5.0 had ever been released, it would have come out in
1998.  I'd be shocked if ANY modern framework functioned in a 16 year
old browser: I expect this was a typo.  If you mean that it's
producing numbers that bad in a modern browser, yes, that's an issue.
Could you clarify?

# Social Engineering: Building A Community On Purpose with Mike Hoye

Community building in Open Source is usually "organic" - meaning
"accidental, unsupervised and messy". The bazaar has matured a lot in
the last twenty years, though, and now we know a lot about how we can
do better. Mike Hoye, Mozilla's Engineering Community Manager, would
like to tell you what works, what doesn't, and why that's important.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

## Schedule

* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub 54 Dundas St East for refreshments and more socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any

Sure; that's what's reported in the current Firefox. Chrome also returns
5.0; but also adds some other output to hint it's a newer browser.

(Is anyone on this list running a 16 year old browser for anything but tiny
embedded system needs or lulz? I used to run the Chimera browser for far
longer than strictly necessary as I was an SGML nerd and it supported HTML
3.0, not the vile 3.2)

Checking Brython's issues, I see this is flagged. It's doing something
unwise with JS's int methods when it should be using bigints.

As a brythonic Scot (there aren't that many of us) I would like to approve
of this message ...
