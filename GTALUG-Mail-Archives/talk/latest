NACK, NACK.

Who's there?

ATM.

ATM who?

NACK, NACK.


"NACK" is a "negative acknowledgement", a very old communications
protocol for "I don't understand". NACK usually forces a
resynchronization or renegotiation between end points. ATM is
"Asynchronous Transfer Mode"; a couple of decades ago it was a
relatively high-speed packet technology that lost out to other
technologies. - via <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1590009/773209>

The TCP joke is a personal favourite:


"Hi, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."

"Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."

"OK, I'll tell you a TCP joke."

"Ok, I will hear a TCP joke."

"Are you ready to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I am ready to hear a TCP joke."

"Ok, I am about to send the TCP joke. It will last 10 seconds, it has
two characters, it does not have a setting, it ends with a punchline."

"Ok, I am ready to get your TCP joke that will last 10 seconds, has
two characters, does not have an explicit setting, and ends with a
punchline."

"I'm sorry, your connection has timed out. Hello, would you like to
hear a TCP joke?"

With thanks to Scott Sullivan who told me this one, I think it's a
great follow-up to the TCP joke:

"I'd tell you a UDP joke but you might not get it."

Which also says a lot about the difference between the two protocols ...

I emailed Gordon Bell about this and he says that he was mistaken about

I used "penultimate" in a draft of my masters thesis but my supervisor
suggested replacing it with "second last" because it was more likely
to be understood and in no way inferior.  He was right.

I have done this once upon a time...  checking the scripts I used:

Step 1: launch qemu with -gdb like so:

qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel /path/to/kernel -gdb
tcp:10.0.0.1:1234 [all the other options]

(In my case 10.0.0.1 is bridged with the host.)

Step 2: Make a gdbinit file that looks like:

set architecture i386:x86-64:intel
target remote localhost:1234
file vmlinux
# this part is deep magic - check /proc/modules for correct offsets
add-symbol-file net/wireless/cfg80211.o 0xffffffffa00000000
# and so-on for whatever modules you care about
continue

Step 3: Launch gdb on the host

YMMV -- I rarely have used an actual debugger for my own kernel work.
I do frequently use gdb to do the same thing as addr2line by running
gdb on the .ko and then "l *addr+0x123" -- to resolve symbols from
oops messages, but you don't need qemu or remote gdb for that.

I haven't done that. I have seldom used gdb directly. If I'm doing debugging 
I use gdb via ddd. The ddd program makes debugging a lot easier (for me) 
than the command line based gdb.

Subject: [GTALUG] No sound from Intel HD Audio -- solved!
Message-ID: <20150902163716.GA3920@node1.localdomain>

Hi,

Finally, I've got sound from Intel HD Audio, through default card=0 !

I recently bought H97 motherboard and i3-4170, because I couldn't afford
electricity for my 125W AMD 8-core and overheating motherboard.
According to my calculation, i3 will pay for itself in a year.

Everything was ok, except sound.  On this H97 board, the default card=0
is HDMI, and audio ports are card=1.  
    - I got KDE making notification sound by changing precedence order
      in "phonon" setting.
    - I managed to get 'mplayer' playing on card=1 by
	    ao=alsa:device=hw=1.0
      and 'aplay' playing on card=1 by
	    -D default:PCH

Still, YouTube or Flash played video, but no sound.  Installing discrete
sound card would not help, because that would only become card=2.

I was about to go back to the AMD block heater, when accidental click
lead me to a solution.  Solution was ~/.asoundrc
    pcm.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
    }
    ctl.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
    } 

Now, I've got sound from default card=1, without those funky
configuration settings.

Last I looked at it (a long time ago), ddd had to be one of the worst,
most buggy, awful ui, pieces of crap I ever encountered.  Even makes
eclipse seem like a good idea in comparison.  So bad I have never ever
considered looking at it again.  I assumed it had to have died out from
being so bad.

Never had the pleasure.  But Kevin, don't fear the command line.  A
well-designed graphical debugger is a good and useful tool, but when you
absolutely need to get into the plumbing; memory setup, ICE hardware
protocols, etc. (ad nauseam) you almost inevitably go sideways from where
the GUI designers intended.  Kvm-qemu kernel debugging probably falls
squarely in this category.  All roads lead to gdb, it sometimes seems...

I know what you mean. When I first tried ddd it would often crash in the 
middle of your debug session if you looked at it wrong, but it did recover.

The UI hasn't changed a whole lot from the early days but it has gotten a 
bit less prone to crash. It usually works for me so I haven't bothered to 
look around and see if there is something better that can be used in place 
of ddd.

I didn't even know they had a Steeles location.  I used to frequent the
Queen store years ago, when I worked downtown.  They had lots of stuff
there, some of it even useful.  ;-)

One item I bought there was an S-100 bus prototyping board, which I used
to build an 8 port serial card for my IMSAI 8080.  I actually populated
3 of the ports, but, with the 8250 UART, it was just as easy to design
the board for 8 ports as 4.  In designing and building that board, I
found a bug in the 8250 that Western Digital was unaware of.

I was in the vicinity of the Queen store recently and saw it was now
upstairs.  The last time I was in there, it was on the main floor and
basement.

gdb's command line is certainly overwhelming to many, but if I was really
desparate for an interface to gdb, I would use emacs, and I am a vim user.

Hi Bob,

Thank you for all the pointers. I may keep bothering you if I still have
issues eh ?

Something you said  " I have done this once upon a time..." made me type
this:

aruna at debian:~/linux-4.1.2$ find . -name "*.c" | xargs grep -i " bob
copeland "

and guess what find says:

Holy Wow ! file system, wireless, usb ? holy wow again.. ( proceeds to fall
off my chair ..)

Yeah 2005 was a long time ago I was still using Windows 3.1 and had no idea
what Linux was :)

Privileged to meet you Mr.Copeland ( So what is it with folks who's names
begin with Bob ? All the Bob's I know are possibly related to Einstein ?
Including our own Mr.Jonkman )

Seriously many thanks for taking the time to reply it IS much appreciated !

Oh yes, the qemu command line is quite something.  I do find the syntax
more understandable than gdb though.

That is probably because you have more gray matter ( gray matter in
this case equates to long years of lived experience + testing +
breaking things then wash+rinse+repeat till you finally fix things.. )

I still *cringe* when I have to fire up qemu.. hopefully someday I
will feel comfortable but right now every single time I do this I
actually do PRAY ! ( Seriously I kneel then PRAY ! yes dat bad.. )

Len, if I may please I am setting up a few servers for a good friend
and they are running Zimbra Servers and Zimbra has it's own bundled
Apache so I do not see the usual /var/www root and the log files are
huge. Seriously huge. Any suggestions on how best to tweak for
performance ?

I also see free -m -l -t telling me it is hogging memory like
anything. Is this a Zimbra issue or ? Once again how best to resolve ?

The logs are purged daily so am guesing teh amount of transactions
through Zimbra is causing the weight ?

This is my first exposure to Zimbra and Servers actually so please
have mercy and be gentle.

Thanks - Aruna

Sure, feel free to CC me as well in case I seem unresponsive,
sometimes I don't read the TLUG list so closely.

As I found then, a great way to learn about the kernel is to write a
file system :)

I now do a small amount of ongoing development in linux wireless for
work, particularly in mesh.  It's good fun.

I did an internet search a day or two back. There are other alternatives to 
ddd for gdb front-ends and found a list of them at
     https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends

One of them that looks interesting is Gede. It isn't available for the 
distro I'm running (Linux Mint) so it would have to be built from the source 
files.

For now I'll stick with ddd. I'm used to it and I seldom need a source level 
debugger so I'm not particularly motivated to search for something else to use.

Another program that has an almost overwhelming command line is avrdude. 
Fortunately I knew of avrdude-gui as a way to tame it. It was old but I 
updated it for use with a current version of avrdude.

One of these days I'll post the updated version of avrdude-gui to my website.

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec-+xVt7Rfz2SP=T56JKqzbWeEck_=Bi1X8bWo+KOZOtxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone! Thought I'd tap the collective brain. I'm looking for a
relatively inexpensive laptop for my son, who mostly just plays minecraft
(and occasionally needs the computer for school work, using google docs & a
browser). Any suggestions of models, or places to buy? I'm looking for
something pretty inexpensive, but with dedicated graphics that will allow
him to play minecraft comfortably for the next year or  so at least.

Thank you!

Note: these different sources have units with different generations of
Intel processors, and I seem to recollect that that matters for GPU
power.

But I don't really think that these are great for the price
considering that they are used.  It depends on how much you value the
ThinkPad attributes (good keyboard, repairable, very well-built,
heavy).

These use the CPU chip's built-in GPU.  Although Intel's GPU has been
getting better, it was fairly poor for gaming in older generations.
Someone who knows more about Minecraft performance would perhaps know
if these GPUs are good enough.  Or use google
<http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hardware_performance>

I would *guess* that current Intel i-series processors would have a
good enough GPU for Minecraft.  I would also guess that the GPU part
of any recent AMD APU is good for Minecraft (APU is what AMD calls
their CPU + GPU chips).  But beware: low-end AMD CPUs are very slow by
today's standards (and they go by a lot of different names).  This is
cheap but I think that it isn't quite good enough:

A4 series are probably too weak.

Shoppers Drug Mart has a bunch of cheap notebooks on sale this
weekend.  I have no idea about their specs since SDM's ad doesn't give
model numbers!  They have a points bonus today which actually
makes a difference in the effective cost (if you are willing to bother
with their points program).

I'm typing this on my first notebook.  I bought it in 1999.  It is 
woefully obsolete, but it really does work.

- NEC Versa SX

- Pentium II at 233MHz

- 256M of RAM

- 1024 x 768 screen (actually, I like the aspect ration)

- 16 bits / pixel (oops) and a Trident video chip (support in X isn't 
  100%)

- Fedora Core 1

- ethernet card plugs into a PCcard slot

Via some simplified version of Moore's law, things ought to be better by 
about a factor of 1000 (two to the power of (16 years / 18 months)).

- Processor clock speed is faster by a little more than 10.  The work done 
  per clock tick is perhaps 2 or 4 times greater.

- The RAM is larger by a factor of 100 (the machine came with 64M).

- disk space has gone up by perhaps 250.  It came with a 4GB drive and I 
  upgraded it to 10GB

- screen resolution has gone up perhaps a factor of 2 horizontally and 1.3 
  vertically

- keyboards don't seem better.  Trackpads do.

- price has gone down a bit.

Emacs has a good (or gud?) interface to GDB, but sometimes it lacks one
feature or another.

What I recommend to every GDB beginner (or even non-beginners, because
they also don't know about this feature) is TUI, the Text User Interface
inside GDB itself.  It is ncurses-based, and after a long period of
being unmaintained (and buggy), it has been receiving some TLC again
lately.

To enter TUI, press C-x a.  To leave TUI, C-x a again.

If you're a GNOME user you might give Nemiver a try, too.

Subject: [GTALUG] Better font rendering for Linux: Infinality
Message-ID: <55EC48B3.5000704@gmail.com>

Just in case there's anyone out there still suffering from most distros'
appalling font rendering, Infinality can make a huge difference. Some
(slightly debian-specific) instructions on installing it:
http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html

Ubuntu 15.04 was still defaulting to a horrible mix of bitmap and vector
fonts for certain applications until I installed Infinality. Font
rendering is fractionally slower, but at least it looks like it's on a
computer display from this century.

cheers,
 Stewart

Compare this with the hardware spec of the Amazon Dash button, a
single-purpose device used for ordering things you're running low on
from Amazon Prime:

     * 120 MHz 32-bit micro-controller with 128 KB RAM and 1 MB
       program data storage
     * additional 16 MB of non-volatile storage
     * 24-bit digital audio microphone/sampler with a flat response
       from 60 Hz - 15 kHz
     * 802.11n wifi module

I think they're about $10 … that's a lot of processing power spent just
on ordering one brand of laundry detergent.

cheers,
 Stewart

Another (almost historic) landmark is about to be lost? It just won't be the 
same to walk along Queen Street east of Spadina and not see the Gorilla 
standing on the side walk.

I remember noticing that Active was upstairs the last time I was in the 
area. They used to be on the main floor and had a basement to visit. I 
wouldn't be surprised if rents have gone up too much for them. That section 
of Queen St. West has gotten really upscale since the days I used to work at 
Arkon Electronics in the 80's.

I suspect, too, that a lot of electronics industry has dried up around
T.O. in the last 30 or so years, and so new surplus and leftovers aren't
being created.

Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,

I have been appointed the election's returning officer, aka the guy who
counts the votes.

There are two openings for the board this year. We are looking for people
to fill the vacancies. If you wish to run for the board please send me your
name. Officially, I will need a member to second your nomination, but that
can be done at the AGM in October.

Although this is not a big commitment of time, please understand that it
does involve a commitment. There is one monthly meeting of the executive
which includes the board to discuss operational issues that you are
expected to attend.

Thanks,

Bill

I would not think minecraft is heavy on the graphics either.

Sorry about that.  I'm still learning to use BlackBerry Q10.‎ Now I know why RIM went belly up. Whoever designed UI must have been on drug.

I rarely do email on my phone.  I just tried sending one to myself from
gmail on my blackberry, and yes it is a horrible mess.

Selecting 'plain text format' from the menu before sending does generate
a perfectly nice message though.  I wonder why they don't do dual format
like sane mail clients do.  Maybe I should do a feature request.
Being able to set plain text as default would be a nice feature too.
Being able to set it as a setting for each email address in the contacts
would be ideal.

Wanted to say a belated thank you to everyone.  I don't think a thinkpad is
the right tool for htis particular job, though I've had only thinkpads
myself for the last little while. our experience has been that even recent
T-series laptops with pretty decent integrated intel graphics are just a
little slow for adequate gameplay.  It looks like there are quite a few
used gaming laptops hovering around the $500 mark on Craigslist:

And that seems a pretty good option for now!

These are rather bad. No back plane, the front fan is friction held with power supplied over goofy spring contacts.

These are ones I'm using.

Trayless, fans are not too loud and look great in my 20 year old tower case.

My experience also says thinkpads can handle being brought places, while
many gaming laptops break very easily due to cheap crappy screen hinges
and such.  Very annoying.

I don't fear the command line. I just don't use gdb enough to know all its 
commands. I would need a cheat sheet in order to use it effectively from the 
command line. The extent of my command line use of gdb is limited to loading 
a core dump, loading the file with the symbol table and getting a backtrace.

I find it convenient to be able to watch the contents of multiple variables 
and easily dig through structures in GUI front-ends to gdb. I haven't gotten 
in to some of the other types of programming/issues you mentioned so ddd has 
been ok for me so far.

I read about a way to set up ddd for debugging of AVR microcontrollers using 
the AVR version of gdb but I haven't tried doing that yet. Using avr-gdb 
could get me into using gdb from the command line if I find I really need to 
use it.

Subject: [GTALUG] GTA Monitor Repairs
Message-ID: <55F744C0.4020808@dinamis.com>

Hello,

I purchased a new 4k Wasabi Mango UHD420 monitor on eBay from Korea in 
May and now it needs service. It's not feasible to ship this 42" monster 
back to Korea for service. I have a SquareTrade warranty that will cover 
local repairs. Does anyone know of any repair shops in the GTA or 
someone who will come out to my place to fix this thing?

If you're curious how this works with Linux, I had to upgrade my video 
card to a GeForce 960. I bought an ASUS because that's the only 
manufacturer that has local RMA, apparently. I had to install the binary 
driver. It didn't work with Fedora 20. I didn't waste any time 
troubleshooting it and just did a clean install of Fedora 21. I keep 
/home on a separate partition so I was back in business in under 20 
minutes. All I had to do to make the fonts look right in KDE was to 
check "Force fonts DPI" and set it to 105 in System Settings>>Fonts.

When this monitor works, it's beautiful. Unfortunately, it appears the 
electronics in this thing are half-baked. Within a week, the screen 
started losing sync on the right side and eventually died on the right 
side. It's an interesting failure mode because this is one panel, not 
two. I offered to replace the defective parts if the eBay vendor shipped 
them to me. They were only too happy to do that because under the terms 
of the sale, they would have had to pay shipping both ways, which I'm 
guessing for something this size would easily be $200. They sent me a 
new video board and I replaced it in about half an hour. From the time 
the monitor failed to the time it was running again was just under two 
weeks. The vendor seems to answer no more than one email every 24 to 48 
hours.

That board worked perfectly until July when I started seeing "tearing" 
all over the screen as it momentarily lost sync. I reported this to the 
vendor and they wanted a video of it happening to do anything about it. 
It wasn't happening in a predictable or frequently enough that I 
bothered. Last week, the "tearing" got worse and there was a new 
symptom. The brightness would fluctuate on its own. (I had turned off 
adaptive brightness because it didn't work well for me.) This progressed 
to the screen going completely dark with a regular popping noise coming 
from the internal speakers. If I turn off the monitor and let it cool 
down, it will turn on again and the loss of sync and eventually going 
black cycle will be repeated.

is there a TeamViewer-like solution for ssh only devices?
I have a few remote Linux/FreeBSD systems that I take care of, but I don't

essentially it allows SSH over HTTPS.

The description says:

Shell In A Box implements a web server that can export arbitrary command 
line tools to a web based terminal emulator.

Sounds like something that needs to be used with extreme caution to avoid it 
being a way to compromise a system.

It's fantastic if you're working on a contract where you're on a locked
down Windows workstation, all ports are blocked, you can't install
software and you need to go through a proxy.

...provided you're not concerned about them asking for an explanation.

I rarely do email on my phone.  I just tried sending one to myself from
gmail on my blackberry, and yes it is a horrible mess.

Selecting 'plain text format' from the menu before sending does generate
a perfectly nice message though.  I wonder why they don't do dual format
like sane mail clients do.  Maybe I should do a feature request.
Being able to set plain text as default would be a nice feature too.
Being able to set it as a setting for each email address in the contacts
would be

ideal.



There are some settings for gmail available on the desktop that one can't
access in the mobile app. There is an option there about sending in plain
text.

I hate TeamViewer. I do everything with SSH, unless I have to talk to a 
windoze box.

Moving sshd to a different port will remove 90% of hacking attempts. Use 
strong passwords, or even better keys! I use iptables to only allow 
access from a small set of machines over the internet. Also one of the 
best programs I've found which turns ssh into a VPN (for all my purposes 
anyway) is sshuttle.

sshuttle is very nice!

I have a vps with ssh in a random port, and sshpot on 22. I put Google Auth
PAM module on ssh, so if anyone logs from an ip not from my range, will
have to supply the code too.

Subject: [GTALUG] Using (Tomato) Linux (Router) as Web Proxy Server.
Message-ID: <086A4898-CC45-459C-BDFA-FB4CE74E69D6@gmail.com>

Request for help:
Using (Tomato) Linux (Router) as Web Proxy Server.

I remotely manage several Tomato networks.

I would like to connect to the ISP's Usage Data web page, from the remote network, to check the remote network's data usage.

I'd also like to run the ISP-specific (web browser) speed test from the remote network, to check the remote network's data rates.

These seem like very ordinary, simple things to want to do.
I'd like to find someone who has actually done these things, and who can help me do them.
(I have found dozens of "how-to" web pages that don't work for me. But I have not found anyone who has said

"I do this all the time, and here is how I do it". Instead, I have found many people who have said "I have never done this, and I won't try to do it myself it, but you should try this ....")

Being able to do a web search on "my IP" and get the remote (proxy) host's IP address is really all need.

So, if there is someone who actually has done this, please help!
Thank you very much.

Many years ago (so this almost falls into the category of "I haven't
done this but you should try it" - sorry ... but it did work then) I
had a pretty good system for finding my home IP.  I did it from the
home computer, not the router: you should have router access, which
should make it easier.  My home computer would check the IP address
assigned to the router every five minutes on a cron job, and if it
found the IP was different from last time, it would update the IP on a
web page and post it to my public web server.  That section of the
website was password-protected (although not encrypted, something I
would definitely do now).

I hope this is useful, sorry it's so vague.

I use inadyn-mt <https://sourceforge.net/projects/inadyn-mt/> to push IP
changes over to domains on afraid.org.

Unfortunately, there have been issues with such packages making the
processes pretty fragile.

I used to use "plain inadyn"; had to jump to a fork that seemed better
maintained.  (I'm not sure the difference continues to be true.)

I believe that dd-wrt and open-wrt include inadyn deployments for updating
"home IPs".

That much probably only requires a proxy at the remote site, presuming
the ISP shows the graph corresponding to the customer IP that's asking.

I've used a Squid instance on a remote host together with SSH
port-forwarding my browser there, but that may be overkill.  ("Nothing
succeeds like excess.")

Using the SOCKS-protocol support in SSH and Firefox would probably
suffice to get your traffic coming out at the other end of the connection.

> I'd also like to run the ISP-specific (web browser) speed test from the remote network, to check the remote network's data rates.

I'd strongly suspect that proxying your web connection back out over
the same link will badly skew the test (especially with asymmetric
data rates!).  Even running a browser remotely over VNC or the like
will use a chunk of your bandwidth.

Putting up MRTG and Smokeping instances tracking link utilization and
health may do a better job than those web-animation doovers, along with
letting you look at history when someone complains how bad it was an
hour ago.

MRTG monitors traffic levels, so requires SNMP access or other means of
getting interface packet counters.  You'll be able to tell from the
maximum inbound and outbound levels what speeds you're getting; the
graphs will generally cap at the same level everytime someone downloads
something big.  Typically you monitor your own router and get stats on
that first hop to your ISP.

Smokeping is a similar tool that shows latency and packet loss, so
typically you want to have it ping the ISP router and more distant
targets you have to reach (your webserver in colo, for example) to see
how good or bad the experience is at the moment.  Compare to the MRTG
picture to see if things get rough during big uploads and/or downloads.

I've done rather a lot of monitoring, and Icinga (Nagios), MRTG, and
Smokeping are the sorts of thing I set up watching the links and hosts
I care about.  Back in my ISP days we had a few locally-grown tools too.

If they're on dynamic addresses some form of dynamic DNS is probably a
piece you'll need.

Subject: [GTALUG] question -- how to boot from USB with multiple ISOs?
Message-ID: <20150926145343.GA1785@node1.localdomain>

Hi all,

Right now, I'm carrying around 2 USB sticks,
    - one 32GB -- it boots Linux and contains about 10 bootable ISOs.
    - one 8GB -- to 'dd' the real ISO that I want to boot.

It's 2-step process, and it's ok.  But, I would like to reduce it to
1-step.

How can I boot those multiple ISOs directly from one USB stick?

Eg. if you want to boot Fedora/Ubuntu/Clonezilla, what do you do?  I
guess you can carry around 3x8GB USB sticks,
    http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=11_180_632&item_id=073667
but 1x32GB USB stick,
    http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=11_180_181&item_id=058767
is better, I think.

As a generic option, the answer is that you can't do it.

There are things like unetbootin which knows various installers and ISO
images and knows what changes to make to the boot procedure for each
one to fake it and let it work.  But it is not generic.

And the dd of one ISO also only works in the case that it is actually
and image capable of working from USB instead of a CD/DVD, which is
certainly true for many these days but is also not generic.

Something like this would be a generic solition:
http://isostick.com/

It actually DOES emulate a USB DVD drive with the iso image.

Just like unetbootin, it is far from generic.  It works for many things,
but not everything.

A pure software solution that is generic is not possible as far as I know.

It's an interesting idea, but I don't expect it's nearly possible.  And not
because it is forcibly infeasible...

The various Linux distribution projects need to define "boot disks" to
enable installing Their Thing.  In practice, they often have multiple
choices that they need to offer their users, hence you commonly have such
options as...
  - Install [Flavor of] Linux
  - Run recovery disk to clean up [Flavor of] Linux
  - Perhaps an "advanced" console

They therefore define some sort of dispatcher for their respective set of
choices.

It would certainly be *plausible* to have that dispatcher take on a larger
set of options, hence to pick those actions for a larger set of flavours of
Linux.

However, that would require cooperation between groups that are accustomed
to not needing to have tight interactions.  (e.g. - gotta have Debian guys
working with Fedora guys for a single 'logical disk' definition that would
do all their respective things)

Frankly, little USB sticks are sufficiently small and cheap that I'd be
happy having a sheaf of them on a cord.

Curiously, I have stopped doing this sort of thing lately; I find PXE
booting easier to set up for the infrequent cases where I need to do so.
When I built my last box <http://linuxfinances.info/info/steele.html> last
year, I ran into problems trying to boot off a CD/DVD, and found PXE easy
enough to configure that I'd be inclined to do that next time.  That
doesn't require having a USB stick at all!  :-)
