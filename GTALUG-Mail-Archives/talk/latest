All newspaper websites have to compete for clicks, especially when faced
with the brutal onslaught that is the Daily Mail. The Guardian is run by
an independent foundation, and is able to carry stories (like the whole
Wikileaks/Snowden thing) that others won't touch. It's also (formerly)
famous for its lack of proof-reading, hence its nickname, The Grauniad.

The Globe and Mail used to share more stories with the Guardian, but
ever since the Globe lurched more to the right, these have tapered off
to nothing.

A new Raspberry Pi 2 is set for release with a new Broadcom BCM2836 quad
core Cortex A7:

http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/02/02/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/

My understanding is this new RPi moves to ARMv7 and I will be able to run
the vanilla ARM release of Debian Jessie?

Fellow netheads:


Schedule:
==========================
The schedule is out.  It is currently a graphic image, but we are
working on a proper non-graphic rendered clickable version.
	https://www.netdev01.org/schedule


Registration:
==========================
There was a glitch in the registration web site yesterday.  We apologize
for the inconvenience and it is now working again.  Please try again if
you had difficulty.
https://onlineregistrations.ca/netdev01/
$100/day, or $350 for 4 days (Cdn dollars). (online reg closes Feb 12th)
Please register as early as practical.  Registering helps us plan properly for
numbers of attendees, ensuring venue sizes and supplies are appropriate without
wasting resources.


Hotel discount rates deadline extended
==========================
The Westin Hotel is still holding a block of rooms for Netdev01 at a
guaranteed rate of $159.00 or $179.00 (depending on the type of room
required) and there are still a few rooms available.
We've been able to negotiate an extention to the block of rooms at the
hotel earlybird special rates beyond the discount rate deadline, but
when they are gone, they are gone.  There were still several people able
to register over the weekend.
There are lots of big and small hotels in Ottawa, but they will fill up
fast as Winterlude approaches, so book something soon.  There may be
some possibilities to billet locally, but don't leave it last minute.
Make your reservations at:

I dunno, the Raspberry Pi Foundation works pretty closely with Broadcom,
and also with Microsoft on supporting Windows 10. This would have taken
some planning, and I'm not sure that they consider Odroid to be a
competitor.

The real question is, is the new machine:
* The Raspberry Pi ? (for those who feel that it's
  necessary to have ? = 2?), or
* The Raspberry Pi 10 (since ?? ? 10, for most engineering purposes)

Enquiring Minds Want To Know!

# Round Table Q&A Session

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.


## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:

Well except the kernel, which will obviously not support this new chip yet.

But other than that, it very well might work.

I'm in for that!

But just to clarify, a formal key signing doesn't need government issued ID. The formality stems from the use of a keysigning key (one specially generated to sign the keys of the participants), and that each participant reads out his/her key fingerprint, and is vouched for by other participants who know him/her.

I went back to the store to re-examine the T410 more closely and to look 
into the T420 as someone suggested. My attention switched to a T520 that 
he had available for $20 more than the T410. It has Intel wifi 
(Centrino) and switchable graphics (Intel & Nvidia). It presently has 
nvidia but he said I could get intel graphics instead. I don't know if 
this switchable thing means that I can swap graphics cards.

Unless someone sounds an alarm soon, I'll be buying the T520 later in 
the week.

Thanks,

John.

The T420/T520 like the T430/T530 should have nvidia optimus, which
means it has both intel and nvidia graphics, and switches on the fly
when asked to.

You can select in the BIOS which one it should enable by default at boot.

Obviously when the nvidia is off and the intel only in use, the battery
life is a lot better.

For that matter I believe even the T410/T510 has nvidia optimus.

Message-ID: <54D04CE5.9090005@dinamis.com>

Hello All,

I have an invite for a One Plus One phone to give away. The first person
to respond to me privately and actually wants to buy the phone for
personal use gets it. I'm not charging anything for it and trust that
you won't be selling the invitation. You must use the invite before 8:30
am on Tuesday. If I don't hear from anyone in the next couple of hours,
I'll just post it on the forums on the OPO site.

I have the 64GB sandstone black model with the OPO flip case. It was
US$391.38 including DHL shipping. I ordered on a Wednesday morning and
had the phone in my hands on Friday afternoon after paying another
C$64.90 in customs brokerage fees, HST, and duties. I'm very happy with
the phone and I'd recommend it.

To me, the display resolution is important.  You can get anything from
1366x768, 1440x900(?), 1920x1080.  There may be an IPS screen option
too, which is quite nice.  You haven't mentioned the resolutions on
the models you are considering.  Does it not matter to you?

The Intel + Nvidia choice is probably better than straight Intel.
After all, you can chose which to use (as Lennart pointed out).  For
my use, the Nvidia would probably not be important, but I'd take it if
it was inexpensive or free.

Clearly the T4x0 is easier to carry than the T5x0.

We have T520, W520, and T530 and they seem to be pretty good
workhorses.  But my main notebook is a Lenovo Yoga 2 pro and that is
much better as a portable device (more screen resolution, lighter,
thinner, longer battery life).  As workstations, the Thinkpads are
much more powerful and upgradeable/repairable.

Though the X series is supposed to be the easiest to carry.  I have
memories of jogging around Ottawa with an old A-series Thinkpad on
my back, and I was younger back then.

I've tended toward the laptop being for away only, and a proper desktop
machine at home, but laptop performance has gotten up to the point of
making sense as a primary machine, and then there isn't the hassle of
maintaining two systems and the laptop always being woefully out of date
and needing a lot of OS updates and personal file transfers when being
pulled out for a trip.

(Maybe a compute server, or render farm, at home is still an option for
the occasional thing needing a lot of horsepower...)

It looks like the X220 is the last X-series machine from before Lenovo
got silly, and the i7-based models can be had with USB3 for moving data
around.  That last feature is something I don't see on as many current
Thinkpads as I thought I should.

The screen resolution is not great but it suits my needs (1366x768). And 
it does have a multi card reader. Unfortunately, it has no USB3. The 
specs in general are good, but not the latest greatest.

Overall, I think it's not only good for my application, it's also a good 
fit for Linux (as per all the feedback, for which I am grateful as it 
puts my mind at ease).

Thanks,
John.

I seem to recall USB3 arrived with the x30 models.

I'll observe that it is now the "Restaurant Formerly Known As Love at First
Bite"; apparently changed management about 2 months ago, along with
removing the Japanese/Thai options from the menu, whilst adding a few more
grill-related things.

All said, if you search webs/maps for it, your search will most likely be
more successful looking for the old name, until such time as the new name
becomes sufficiently storied.

I haven't pay much attention to raspberry-pi before. It comes with an HDMI
port, is it?
How fast would it be to play movies from localnetwork, or play youtube
videos?

Well certainly the new version does support neon as well as vfp3/vfp4.
Of course it also still has the videocore that supports a number of video
decoding options.  Certainly doing it by CPU only was hopeless on the
original pi, but that's not what they were doing in general as far as
I know.

I see
http://www.raspi.today/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-raspberry-pis-epiphany-web-browser/
says that the original can play 720p videos from youtube and vimeo.
It may be that the new CPU cores will help it do more than that.

According to that article the codec licences are not included in the new
RPi2

But are the licences included with the Odroid, or have they just
implemented the code without paying Fraunhofer their dues?

  Depending where on the planet you are, MP3 patents may have already
expired in your jurisdiction as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Licensing_and_patent_issues
This is not legal advice; see a real lawyer for that.

# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

PodCamp[1] is a DemoCamp-like conference for people interested in 
Podcasting and general content creation on the Internet. I went a few

There's also Ethiopiques at 277 Church. It might be a bit messy for most
folks, but it's a very sociable way to dine.

If we are doing a key signing, I can also bring CACert forms. If you want
to mess around with X.509 certs at no cost, it's worth a look.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

It's really hard to tell what's going on in Cyanogen Inc.'s "mind".
They sure don't seem to be free-software types from their talk or
actions.

Here's a summary from a comment posted to the article
<http://www.androidauthority.com/cyanogen-google-kirt-mcmaster-582373/>

How can you sign an exclusive deal with free software?

    The gist of it is that OnePlus was supposed to launch the One in India
    with CyanogenMod as usual, but Cyanogen left OnePlus out in the cold
    by signing an exclusive agreement with Micromax from India. The
    agreement states that Cyanogen is to exclusively support the latter's
    upcoming online brand Yu -- a direct competitor of OnePlus -- in
    India.

    The big problem is that Cyanogen apparently knew fully well that
    OnePlus was going to expand to India and decided to sign the agreement
    with Micromax anyway, backstabbing the brand that had helped them so
    far. According to OnePlus's co founder Carl Pei, OnePlus "can't
    explain Cyanogen's decision because we don't fully understand it
    ourselves,". Keep in mind that during this time OnePlus was swamped
    with things like their deal with Amazon India, their Black Friday sale
    and the opening of their store in Beijing.

    This forced the already busy OnePlus to start developing their own ROM
    based on Android Lollipop. This could've ended right there, but
    Cyanogen's founder Steve Kondik took to Google+ and accused OnePlus of
    stealing features from CyanogenMod for their own ROM. This act was the
    solidifying act that will probably end their relationship not too long
    from now. For now, all international units are still supported by
    Cyanogen, but Pei has hinted that they may no longer continue updating
    the phone in a year.

    TL;DR - OnePlus wanted to release the One in India, Cyanogen
    backstabbed them by signing an exclusive deal with Micromax, OnePlus
    got frustrated and decided to make their own ROM, Cyanogen accused
    them of stealing from Cyanogen and their relationship is now very
    rocky.

So of course at this point any sane person would know that Cyanogen is
not to be trusted at all.  Don't make any deal with them, because they
don't care about you at all.

I wonder if even Microsoft might start to regret getting involved
with them.

The whole question of theft of intellectual property is a pretty grey
area in the digital millennium. Is reverse engineering theft? if it
was Dell sure made it past the post on that one. There's lots of
mythos around the development of software. Didn't IBM open up their
architecture for a reason? wasn't that reason so the technology should
develop in a sustainable way? I seem to recall that  IBM originally
thought the worlds business computing could be reasonably done on two
or three mainframes through a distributed network.

So when PC bios intelligence features are reverse engineered, it's not
theft it's ummmmm creative math. Or perhaps the term New Math is
better.  More base 2ish. When push comes to shove it's all a numbers
game.

Bill Gates open letter to hobbyists comes to mind. A trade secret is
only valued as a trade secret when steps are taken to protect it. So
when Gates fails to secure the punch-tape and loses control of ALTAIR
BASIC and I'm assuming MITS MOBILE was engaging the "hobbyists" for an
open source intelligence reason, creative math is fair play.

Free beer, free software, free love all relics of the sixties. TANSTAAFL

Many years ago at a TLUG BOF I facilitated I asked John Hall about
emerging open source technology and the people who were most involved
in it's development. To paraphrase he said, the PHD's write the
software but it is the operators who use and perfect it.

So IMHO Gates is a real operator all right and he has a whole class of
people following in his footsteps. They want the thing to work just
well enough to make money but not so well that it doesn't need
constant upgrading and improvement.

Perhaps not if the aim is just to bring disrepute and confusion to the Android
world.

What I don't understand is how much Cyanogen Mod is just Cyanogen Inc.

I always thought that Cyanogen Mod was a real plus for the Android
community and hence probably useful for Google.  For one thing, it was
a way of keeping the device manufacturers a little in line (if the
device manufacturers went too far, their customers would jump ship to
CM).  For another, it meant Android had some hacker cred.

I am now (with insufficient research) thinking that I might want to
avoid CM so as to stay out of the clutches of CI.

I think that pretty much sum's up the situation. Abuse of dominance
seems to be an MS stock in trade, however it's not exclusively theirs.
I think CM is hedging bets, if not jumping ship. There is profit in
confusion whether accidental or deliberate.

I somewhat agree with this although I'm not sure how sanity checking
in a person is achieved. I struggle with this concept myself at times.

I had thought so too and now I'm not so sure. Modularity and
scalability are seen as plus's by hackers but they are in fact the
wild wild west of the technology business. Do you trade features for
security or do you trade security for features. I'd like to think you
can have both but that doesn't seem very likely in the near future.

Look at how stuxnet escaped containment. The real question is who
embedded it in the PLC's in the first place. Note the reports said it
was spread from the isolated networks not to them.

As a blunt force hacker I'm always in somebody's clutches. Isn't the
devil you know better than the devil you don't know? Trust is
extensible and extendible. Security is non-existent, that's a
Microsoft illusion created to pacify small business while the big
business crawl in their back door when they find the front door is
closed.

?Greetings from Singapore.

Sheesh.

You'd think that of all places, a Linux user group forum would be the
*last* place where people would stare at a FOSS software distribution and
not know what it was.

CM is but one of many Android distributions, with a diversity that would
embarrass Distrowatch.


   - There are the commercial ones that add on proprietary bits such as
   Samsung's Touchwiz, indeed the Google reference standard (which only comes
   by default on Nexus and no-name supercheap devices).

   - There are the barely recognizable mutations such as what's used in the
   Kindle Fire, deliberately designed to look as non-Android-like as possible.

   - And then there are the pure FOSS efforts, which include Paranoid
   Android and the hundreds of small-team or single-person efforts that can be
   found on XDA-developers.


So CM turned from a project into a brand,  and attracted outside attention
and money. The BRAND signed an exclusive deal with a handset manufacturer
in India, that will prove to be a Very Bad Move for them because it's
ruined its relationship with a much bigger, global, partner.

And so the drama unfolds.

Since there are no (well not yet) any proprietary bits in CM12, the only
thing that can be "stolen" is the name. That may change. There could be
prorietary bits added to CM (like Samsung, HTC and others do regularly),
and CM could change its app defaults for email, search, cloud storage etc
from Google to MS. (How different is this from Firefox switching its
default search from Google to Yahoo?)

Over the last decade-plus, Linux distribution politics has had more than
its share of soap opera moments... Oracle forking Red Hat, Novell buying
and then divesting SuSE, and the brief fallout from Caldera buying a
company that made Unix for PCs. That last one was entertainment enough to
sustain its own fan site, groklaw.

But not Linux distributions are boring, Very little gawking value these
days.

So the focus is now in Android space, where the stakes are even higher and
some of the players are very, very big. Whether Microsoft is involved in CM
to disrupt Android, or simply to disrupt Google, or simply to give it an
MS-culture-friendly liaison with the Android ecosystem, remains to be seen.
But if nothing else, we have a new source of entertainment and a new form
of distro wars.

It can't do any sustained damage to the ecosystem, and might even result in
some healthy competition.

Grab your popcorn.

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1502120000560.12760@redclaw.mimosa.com>

This week (unless supplies run out, which happens) NCIX has this wireless 
router for $99.49 with free shipping.

This is one that Scott has and recommends for OpenWRT.  He says that you 
should go for Version 2.0 and that the box will say if it is a Version 2.0 
router.  For that reason it may be better to buy it in one of their 
stores.

It has been cheaper (briefly $70 and Future Shop and Best Buy) but not 
often recently.

As a language pedant or peasant, (I never know how to truly label
myself so I usually leave that to others) I wonder what free really
means. Free Open Source Software, looks easy enough to understand, but
in truth what is free. Free stuff, Free radicals, Free willy; the list
of usage and mis-usage of free is endless.

TANSTAAFL we all pay the piper in one way or another.

When word magic is so prevalent in marketing, how do you shake out the
spin and find the stable core of logic.

IBM's VLIW Architecture exploits Instruction Level Parallelism and has
been touted as the natural successor to RISC. However it is the manner
in which you bundle primitive words together in ordinary day to day
language which affects the experiential outcome of the listener.

What happens when you buy the words but they fail you. If you got them
free, there is no liability. The minute you pay for the words, you are
thrust into the deep and murky world of administrative law.

So isn't FOSS, as an administrative acronym, a bit of an oxymoron?

In marketing you are free to buy other words, but who or what insures
the damages caused by word mis-use?

I purchased one of these fairly recently.  Installing OpenWRT was as
easy as I've ever seen it be, and the amount of memory available seems
absolutely immense compared to the WRT-54Gs I'd been working with
previously.  I would love to tell you it's been great, but I haven't
actually used it enough to say that honestly.  So all I can say is
that it's looking good in the little use I've had from it.

If you do buy one and want to use the USB ports (which are 2.0 ... I
wish they were USB3), my stumbling adventures getting the ports to
work may be educational:

Well intel has tried using VLIW 3 times now, and (mostly) failed 3 times.
Only seems to have ever been successful in DSP designs (hence the "mostly"
for intel, with the i860 being fairly successful in DSP use, but not as
a general purpose CPU).

Three billion transistors require a mighty robust memory management
subsystem. Given the development costs of these chip sets and other
factors of parallel advancements in existing architectures, a few
false starts are to be expected. Who knows maybe all this belongs in
the tomorrow file.

Instruction replay RAS and other improvements for checking and
correcting errors, are most certainly desirable features. Fine grained
exit status is essential for lockstepping cache threads and compile
time predication looks like it could be efficient enough for reducing
transport delay. Just need better ram with fewer flaws or perhaps
parallel RAS and journal the bad bits. ECC or not its the uncommon
errors which need to be predicated.

So now the problem is not limited to things like voltage flux, it's
far field interference like background radiation which tend to flip
the bits.

John,

   I have been using efax from the command line.  Finally, I have a proper serial modem in its own package.  I keep it turned off because it is not compatible with my DSL modem.  I have to run one or the other.  I think it works.  I would need someone to practice on.  I have never tried top receive a fax.

Hi All,

I am having a real nagging problem with ssh. I setup dynamic dns so I could
I connect to my box from outside.

My basic setup is a router connected to a cable modem.
I've opened the firewall port 22 tcp/udp on my router.

However he is the problem I am having.

I can ssh into my box from inside my LAN like, ssh 192.168.0.100, works
fine!

However when I try to ssh using my dynamic dns (or the external IP), ssh
will hang and never return.

1) I've tried running my sshd in debug mode and here is the output
=====(SERVER SIDE)=====

Connection from 192.168.0.1 port 48996 on 192.168.0.100 port 22


2) Here is the ssh verbose output
=====(CLIENT SIDE)=====

OpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014

debug1: Connection established.

debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0
debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-8

As you can see from the server output the connection gets established, but
then the hang happens and I can't figure out what's going on?

Someone suggested that sshd might be trying to do a reverse lookup and to
add,

'UseDNS no'

to /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restarting the daemon. This didn't work!

Any ideas? I can't seem to find anything for my particular problem on the
Internet.

run tcpdump on your server when you do the outside connect.
you can
tcpdump -i eth0 -n |grep 209.122.208.175
do you don't get a tonne of crap. You may have to change eth0 to what is
appropriate.
also see if you have any iptables odd rules, or any odd routing.

I had a similar problem a few years ago on Bell DSL, the issue was I was 
SSHing into one of their FreeBSD routers (they fixed this issue a year 
ago by blocking incoming on port 22), I fixed it by change the SSH port 
to 2222.

How does something with an IP address go to the wrong device???  If you
have your own public IP, that router should not be doing anything other
than forwarding to your address.

I had this same problem.
Up until a week or two ago port 22 worked fine.
Then internally 22 was ok but externally it failed. (connection denied
error).
I even called Bell but they denied changing anything.
As soon as I changed everything too port 2222 it all worked fine again!

Perhaps they're blocking port 22.  Try a TCP port 22 traceroute and see
what happens.  Try again with 2222.

Hello everyone,

I'm looking for a solution to a problem of backup and file sync between two
computers. I have the following requirements, and I wonder if what I want
is realistic and is there off the shelf software I can use.

I have several laptops and a desktop that I would like to back up and keep
in sync.

Oops. sorry I accidentally sent the email.

So, I have several laptops and a desktop that I would like to back up and
keep in sync.

* Every client (laptop) is encrypted with cryptsetup and LUKS
* There are different configuration and big image files that  I would like
to back up from each device but not synchronize
* I can host my own server
* I would prefer to store encrypted backup on a cryptsetup and LUKS
partition
* I would like to periodically sync encrypted backup partition to s3/google
drive with minimal overhead
* I only want to mount encrypted backup partition when sync/backup is in
progress and I'm fine with mounting that backup partition with the keys
stored on the client machines in clear text
* I don't have to have web interface or
* I need to automatically do file sync backup for the clients, preferably
based on network location (i.e. when I'm close to backup server, or
connected with a fast link).

I'm thinking of clobbering something together with a bunch of scripts, but
my guess is this problem has been either completely solve, or I can just
use a few big pieces to solve it.

Could you recommend any tools for that?

Thanks,

Alex.

Have a look at btsync from bittorrent.
You can select what directories you want to sync on each computer.
Nothing is stored on their servers, it just syncs your machines.

There's also Sync Thing, which I've used to backup my phone to my home file
server.  It works well and is supported on multiple platforms, is open
source, and actively being developed.

Sorry that I don't have time right now to carefully read your list of
requirements.  But let me throw a thought.

If you go to the trouble of encrypting the filesystem on your
notebooks, it would be great to back it up as-encrypted.  That way
there is only one route to the break the encryption.  (There might
otherwise be two or three.)

Backing up a whole filesystem seems expensive: there are a lot of
empty blocks.

The first time, it is expensive.  You've got to copy all those blocks.

If you use rsync for subsequent backups, I think that it will only
transmit the changed blocks.  That should be affordable.  For safety,
it may be important that the filesystem be read-only while the rsync
is running (that might be awkward).

The only way of recovering is to recreate the raw filesystem and then
use LUKS to get at it.  Is this good enough?

Note: I've never tried this.  It might be a dumb idea.

Yes, you have to keep the fax the other side of the DSL filter. I have the
AIO plugged in to a splitter at the demarcation point, and it works well.
For all of my semi-annual faxing needs ...

Ah faxes...  The government institutions and banks seems to make that
technology stick around.

I don't even have a land line any more so I've been using hellofax.com .  I
think they allow you to send 10 pages a month for free and it supports
things like Google Drive and Dropbox.  I've only used it 3 times now, but
it's worked really well and has a really nice interface.

Thanks for the link. It looks very similar to myfax.com, which I've been 
researching. You can only send 5 pages and receive none on the free 
plan. Was hoping to avoid the $10/mth, hence my original note. And it 
would be cool to put to use the old fax modem I've been saving all these 
years, just in case.

Naturally, cool is in the eye of the beholder :-).

BTW, the 10 pages free a month is for every month, not just the first
month.  I haven't paid a penny with it and sent 3 faxes so far.

But there can be: a tort. Torts arise when you are injured or suffer
loss outside a contract, arising from lack of reasonable diligence by
the person causing the injury or loss. The ancient Debian ssh problem -
where a well-meaning admin patched some code that used uninitialized
variables, not realizing it would make connections less secure - could
have created a tort.

Payment is only one form of consideration required to form a contract. I
suspect that continued use/enjoyment/utility is the consideration for
free software. But what of the software we don't know we're using, like
the low-level stuff that moves our bits about the world: can I choose
not to use that if it takes more than a reasonable effort to find out
what it is?

Wiser folks may of course refer me to the reply given in /Arkell v.
Pressdram/.

Not at all. I'm always open to discussion. First of all a tort is an
UN-intentional breach of contract, from that point it all depends on
how you define low-level bits and reasonable.

In physics you can't just say fuck the low level bits, we'll fix it in
POST, that's media-speak, it just doesn't work that way in the real
world. In this case all the worlds not a stage and all the people
players etcetera etcera etcra etc ...

>From my perspective as a kind of blunt force hardware kind of guy, any
way you look at things, the pressing need is to clean up dirty power,
or build a shield against it. Truth is a kind of a higgs boson, first
it's there, then it's not there, then it's there again. Or is it the
other way round? When you rely so much on truth tables, shouldn't
accuracy be to the nth degree?

That is to the highest level of trust which could be further extended
rather than the lowest.

I forgot, are we talking about physics or law here? If it is truly
both, then the same ordered logic applies, doesn't it?

The fact that you know there is a Higgs Boson, is one you can't
reasonably deny in a court of law, can you? That's neither a
reasonable error or omission. I think it's best to be shielded from
that sort of thing, but I'm a hacker not a lawyer.

Back when I needed to do this, I had extremely good solid use out of
Hylafax and a multitech fax modem. Haven't needed it for a decade, and I
don't know if it's still being maintained, but I can't imagine that it
would need much updating.

And I'm a Repair Cafe fixer - have been almost since they opened the
doors in Toronto.  Here's the website:

http://repaircafetoronto.ca/

I think a lot of the people on TLUG are just as likely to fall into
the "potential fixer" category rather than the "needs a repair"
category.  I'd encourage you to come out even if you have nothing that
needs fixing - to enjoy HackLab (which is a very cool place) and to
get a feel for Repair Cafe, which is vibrant and lots of fun.  We can
always use more volunteers, and being a volunteer for them is
educational, fun, and rewarding.  I'll be there: come say Hi, look
over my shoulder and offer some advice on fixing the broken laptop I'm
likely to have sitting in front of me.

I picked up one of these at NCIX on Saturday...

- Installed it Saturday evening, getting it working as a backup wireless router;
- Upgraded the firmware from TP-Link, which required redoing that configuration
  effort :-(
- Pulled the OpenWRT binaries (per Giles' link), and installed, which was,
  modulo a wee bit of "wait afterwards hoping it worked", about as easy as
  he suggested
- Introduced configuration to have it take over my WAN link, which worked,
  but then didn't seem friendly to needs for incoming connections
  (torrents^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H and ssh), so plugged the old router back
  into place

I poked at sundry sources of docs concerning the differences between
firewall rules and firewall routes, which didn't really tell me anything I
didn't already know or hadn't already done.

Yesterday, I wrote up a script to pull config tarballs off the router and
throw it, version-controlled, into a favorite Git repo, so I have backups.

In keeping with the strategy I described a bit at the last meeting;
anyone interested can review the GTALUG "backups" repository
at GitHub for the broad approach...
See http://github.com/gtalug/backups
That repo doesn't include this, as my router's config isn't GTALUG
business, but the approach in the scripts in the "scripts" directory
should be suggestive.

I wee while ago, I retried the WAN link, basically moving the plug
from one router to the other, and, a mod to gateway addresses in
/etc/network/interfaces later, all now seems copacetic, with no
particularly interesting changes made to explain why incoming
traffic wasn't happening Saturday but is working now.

At any rate, my old Cisco/Linksys WRT310Nv2 will be retiring
as consequence.

The one interesting area that I probably need to poke at more
is that of IPv6 support.  The old router didn't have any (evident)
support.  OpenWRT seems to.  I haven't fiddled with the
configuration, as I could readily see that breaking things.

I had been suppressing IPv6 activity (e.g. - my internal
Bind9 /usr/sbin/named instances being run with the "-4"
option that suppresses IPv6 usage); perhaps that ought to
change now?  I'm not quite sure.

Does your ISP provide IPv6?  If not, you'll need to use some sort of
tunnelling to get it.

Nope, but it is a step up to have a router that can recognize the
traffic.  And presumably I could run a tunnel atop OpenWRT.

"Doing more with IPv6" is probably a talk of interest to more than
just me, if we have folk that have fought thru that.

I have been running IPv6 on my network for almost 5 years.  I get it
through a tunnel from gogo6.  I believe OpenWRT can be configured to use
it.  If you set it up for a subnet, you'll get a /56 prefix, which will
provide 2^72 addresses or about a trillion times the entire IPv4 address
space.

What do any of those have to do with VLIW?

They apply equality to CISC and RISC as well, but at least those tend
to be designed to run real code generated by real compilers rather than
imagined code generated by imagined magical compilers that don't exist.

Message-ID: <CAPpdf5_XTTxdZXsPPMnv0HNQqFBeBYhsu9nrHDf2tdvmVod+bg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings

I have been running a raid 10 array for almost 3 years.

Last September on a reboot (forced by Firefox and kernel memory interaction
problems) came up with one of the drives being listed as DOA.
The raid array has continued to run on 3 drives although on reboots there
is much complaining from whatever in the boot up process.
I had the replacement drive sent to me and today I installed the drive.

I was under the assumption that the raid array would rebuild itself upon
startup with a new drive (4th out of 4).

This did not happen.

I am running Debian Jessie (testing) and have the whole time in question.
I can mount the array and it is visible.
I'm looking at backing up the array (on blu-ray discs) but as I'm now to
circa 45 GB of data and I was at about 22 GB when I last did a backup this
is going to be a momentous event.

How do I ask mdadm to include this new drive into the array? (Without
borking everything!! I have found lots of instructions on how to create but
none in an hour of trying different search phrases on how to rebuild or how
to cause the array to rebuild itself. I have only been able to find
instructions for when the array is totally sick and I'm not there (yet - -
- grin!) but I don't want to wait until another drive craps out to get
things going.)

TIA

First, you should have backups. Why not get an external USB drive? You
can get those quite inexpensive. Heck, even a 64GB thumb drive
shouldn't be too expensive, though flash is not the most reliable.

No matter what, I would start with a good backup. Playing with mdadm
is relatively safe, but if it's your first time playing with it, you
can get yourself into trouble.

Hardware RAID controllers often auto-use replacement drives to rebuild
a degraded array, but mdadm does not. How exactly you go about
repairing the array depends on your specific configuration and which
drive failed. You will need to start by partitioning the replacement
drive such that it matches the existing drives (each array has to have
a partition equal to or larger than the same partitions on the other
drives).

Once partitioned (and rebooted, if needed), you will add the new
partition to the degraded array. Once added, mdadm will start
re-assembling the array. Note that if one of the arrays has /boot,
you'll probably need to run grub's install on the raw disk so that it
can be booted from.

The command to add the new partition to an existing array will look
something like this:

mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/sda1

Obviously, the 'mdX' and 'sdYZ' will need to be adjusted for your
configuration.

For software raid in linux you have to tell it what to do.

So if you want it to add that disk to the raid, you have to use mdadm
to tell it do do that.

If it was partitioned before, you have to do that before adding the
partition to the raid.

I have about 45 GB on the array at present. I had decided to use Blu-ray
discs
for backup when I bought the system. There is no easy to back up method.

I have a separate drive for systems. The array is for storage.

So partitioning the drive is necessary.
OK - - - I hadn't thought of that!

Now I used gdisk to set things up so likely that is where I will need to
start - - - hmmmmmmmmmmm.

Has anyone done anything like this in the somewhat recent past?

(Wondering if when disk is partitioned that mdadm will happily absorb that
disk into the array. Likely will need another reboot too!)

I use parted or fdisk, I am not familiar with other tools. In the end,
what matters is that the partition(s) on the new drive match (equal
size or larger) the existing partitions.

You will then have to tell mdadm to use the new partitions. It will
not "just use them".

As Lennart asked; Show us the output of 'cat /proc/mdstat'. Also,
please share the output of:

parted /dev/sda print free

Yes, I faced your problem late last year.?

You need to prepare your new drive to match existing drive. If the other 3 are not partitioned, leave the new one unpartitioned.?

Then you have to force it into the array using mdadm tool. I know, I spent says avoiding force until Lennart advised to go that way.

Search the tlug old mail for that conversation. If you can't find it, I can look around for precise steps I used to get back up. On transit at the moment so just relying on memory.

No offence intended, but check your notes on DELTA vs. WYSE AC Power.
I believe I have pontificated on this list about that quite enough in
the last decade to correct YOUR errors Lennart.

You didn't even know what the centre tap is, so how could you be
expected to understand dirty AC and the power's relationship to 64 bit
ARCH, VLIW, UART, LSBinit, SGML, HTML, XML, dependency based booting
in Debian, or why they are called script kittys, or the universe in
near and far field effects, randomness and time modification in
transmissions.

Whatever exists in your imagination regarding real compilers and
imagined magical ones are just another ponzi scheme of big oil money
IT, apparently now centred in Alberta. The rest of us try to use a
DELPHI consensus of experts, sort of a Canadian Intelligence Agency.

I cut my teeth on the IBM blue wire fix, no reason for me to jump ship
now. I've been pushing for clean air and clean power in Toronto for a
long time. God bless IBM for opening up their architecture when every
one else was closing up shop. I wonder why they did that?

I might be premature but I believe a trusted compiler is in the works,
it just needs some funding after the dirty power issue is cleaned up
bit bya bit.

Regression testing is a bitch, but you do have to do it one tiny bit
at a time. Believe me I spend a shit-load of time trying to fix up my
own mistakes but the bosses won't let me, so I just have to eat them.

Perhaps you meant delta vs wye 3 phase power.  All that means is
different ways to connect 3 phase transformers.

Given today's power supplies, I don't see much of an issue with "dirty"
power getting through to the circuitry.  In a computer power supply, we
have single phase power that's rectified, run through a power oscillator
to produce high frequency AC, which is passed through a transformer,
rectified and regulated.  Not much chance for that dirty power to make
it through.  Of course, the circuit board will also have capacitors
distributed around it to further reduce noise and improve regulation.

Disk failed last September, and you're replacing it now?  Boy, you got
balls!

You are better off to use whatever utility you used in the first place.
Manual typing would go something like
    man mdadm
    cat /proc/mdstat
    mdadm -D -v /dev/md0
    mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sdx
where
    /dev/sdx is the new disk.  Here, the new device should be the "same"
    as the old.  If the old was a partition (eg. /dev/sda1), then the
    new should be a partition.  If the old was entire device (eg.
    /dev/sda), then the new should be entire device also.

I'm not quite sure what to think about the "maybe MSFT involved"
part of this tale.

I think the truth won't emerge until later, if ever, as a fair bit of
the meaningful detail lies in contractual arrangements that we'll
not get to review.

Downthread, Evan has made the valid observation that these
systems (CyanogenMod, AOSP, and such) are akin to Linux
distributions, and that we should probably not treat it as being
quite as mysteriously as we are.

If you take a visit to xda-developers.com, you'll find a giant
set of projects building customized "Android distributions", of
which CyanogenMod is merely one, though a rather popular
one, which became sufficiently popular that folk put together
a corporation to try to reap some benefits from it.

That isn't entirely unlike how companies like Red Hat Software,
SuSE, and Caldera grew up surrounding the care and feeding
of Linux distributions.

There are places where the "just a distro" analogy breaks,
but it's a good approximate starting place.

The developers that built the CyanogenMod distribution
got set up alongside a company that seems to have set
its feet a bit badly several times already.  (I seem to
recall Caldera being well-liked before they got into the
litigation business at which point they were Rather Less
Well Liked! :-) )

There's a crucial technical difference between Linux
distributions and Android distributions in that Linux
tends to start its focus with C-based code, whereas
Android distributions put the equivalent focus on Java.
But I'd think that a less essential difference.

The *more* essential difference is that Linux
distributions tend to build up their own sets of add-on
software, managing that themselves.  In contrast,
Android distributions tend to be pretty keen on
maintaining the ability to draw from Google Play
Store, and thus requiring that there be entirely a
lot of proprietary third-party code.  "I want
my GMail client."

There are exceptions to that; see F-Droid for a
set of repositories of FOSS packages.  But there
are rather fewer license purists of the Debian sort
on Android.

Further, there's a deeper layer to worry about.
Radio drivers tend to be opaque binaries, so that
RMS-style purists pretty much need to choose
between compromise (that RMS will go to
massive lengths to reject) and deciding they
don't really need a phone terribly badly anyways.

But back to CyanogenMod...  I have been running their
distribution on my phones for a number of years now,
generally pretty happily.  With the recent escapades,
that points me to start looking at alternatives.

- Google isn't vastly trustworthy in this; I have been
  monitoring a Nexus 4 problem where CM11
  was [weird magicky oddness involved] playing
  badly in conjunction with a November release of
  "Google Play Services" such that some new
  Google APIs were mis-playing and causing
  phone calls to be silenced with CM11+Nexus4+
  recent-GooglePlayServices.

  The nature of the problem seems a mite
  magical; it's remarkable to me that only the one
  phone model was misbehaving in the given way.

  The API portion, something called CheckinService,
  looks suspiciously "surveiling on activity" in nature.
  (I don't want to head down tinfoil hat routes, I'll just
  say "oddly suspicious.")

- The formerly most prominent distribution was
  AOSP (Android Open Source Project) which has
  had some troubles.  The senior guy gave up not
  long ago because of difficulties getting driver
  documentation.

- The next most prominent distribution that I'm
  aware of is called Paranoid Android, and the
  folks at OnePlus seem to have been raiding
  them for developers for their inhouse distribution
  efforts.

There's, in effect, bits of trouble all around, making it
not so easy to figure out what to consider as
alternatives.

I hear (haven't seen the details) that the NSA may have gotten code
into disk drive firmware, which puts them pretty deep on any machine
with a disk drive.  But that's a pretty different story.

I have two theories, either the Sweed's snuck it through weeds of AC
power after the poem of Copenhagen or the DTMF phreakers did it by a
thorny crafty RANDom preload. You'd have to check one of the pat nt
zero con scripts handlers to find that one out. If you can't trust
your compiler, what can you trust? I'm no luddite but I know full well
why he did it.

Trade or Craft, weaving is a skill that we all need the work of the
Weavers, if we want to mend old things as well as build new ones.

So when someone comes into my neighbour hood drop in and tells me I've
had a woodpecker in my head since 1976, I look at them with a straight
face and say Soviet? or American? i mean what else can you say to
that?

Thanks for organizing this!

I have to say that the pizza I shared at Love at First Bite before the
February meeting was excellent.

We don't all have to go to the same place, but a critical mass makes
the dinner worthwhile (at least to me).

It has been shown in the past that we should have a predictable place.
Otherwise stragglers (illiterate?) get lost.

Having said all that, I'm tempted to go to Ethiopiques as a one-time
adventure in March.  I'm not proposing it as a permanent relocation.
I'll only go there if I know that others will too.

Now I'll go vote.

(After the voting, if another place that I haven't tried recently
"wins", I may switch.)
