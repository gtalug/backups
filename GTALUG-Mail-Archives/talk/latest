If you can, deliver it to FreeGeek. They'll re-use or refurbish it,
and if it's completely unusable they'll take it apart and get a few
semoleans from their upstream recycler.

Better them than a for-profit recycler.

Yes, that is the best answer.

# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

Subject: [GTALUG] Clean Ubuntu Install Tips
Message-ID: <557A10F9.80104@rogers.com>

I have been running Ubuntu for over a decade. Always did Internet upgrades.

But the last one, to 12.04 broke my PHP and the only solution I have 
found is to do a clean install.

I have /home on a separate drive so I expect that this is not a big 
deal. But I think a few of you might be able to offer a tips.

The system will be a desktop and also a LAMP server. I plan to install 
the desktop and then add the AMP.

I will back up the databases using mysqldump, save the Apache .conf 
files as well as fstab.

Anything else I should consider? Thanks

You could use a configuration management system to declare what the 
final state of the machine should be once you've finished. I've been 
learning SaltStack <http://docs.saltstack.com> over the last couple of 
days and I'm quite impressed. I'm using a masterless minion setup due to 
the fact that the machines that I'm deploying are intended to run behind 
a firewall with no access to the Internet. Here is a resource I found 
useful: 
<http://eon01.com/blog/using-saltstack-to-automate-vagrant-provisioning/>. 
You don't have to use Vagrant but you might want to once you see how 
easy it is to go from deploying your VM locally on VirtualBox to 
deploying to an Amazon EC2 instance, for example.

That might be a simple way to try and fix things but I wouldn't think it 
should be the only way.

You don't say in which way it is broken. You could downgrade PHP, remove all 
packages that have anything to do with PHP and reinstall from your distros 
PHP package, or you could remove all existing PHP packages and install a 
version you built from source.

Another thing is whether the problem is simply a configuration error in 
Apache. You can run some tests on PHP using 'php -a' at a command line to 
run it interactively and see if it appears to be functional or not.

I have tried many things. The problem comes when trying to install 
libapache2-mod-php5

I get this error:

dpkg: error processing package libapache2-mod-php5 (--configure):
subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1
Errors were encountered while processing:
libapache2-mod-php5
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

Using Google I see others have had this problem, but I have not found a 
solution.

I have followed suggestions like these (using sudo):

apt-get -f install
apt-get clean all
apt-get update

apt-get -f install

Then try:

apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

I get the error above.

Follows is the term.log:

I suggest you run post-install script directly and see what is happening
there:

sh -x /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst

Thank you for the suggestion. This is the result:

$ sudo /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst

Stephen,

   This is how I upgrade my Fedora machines. Everything on /home stays intact because I don't reformat it.  I can switch to Ubuntu if I want.  I don't have application data on my root partition.  If I did, I would back it up regularly, and before doing a re-install.  My /etc directory is backed up weekly, automatically.

   I document my install procedure.  I post this on my website to encourage other Linux users, but my original purpose was to be able to it again, later.

I have the same result on my Debian box, when run without parameters.

but this one ends with 'exit 0':
sh -x   /var/lib/dpkg/info/libapache2-mod-php5.postinst configure

(note I run in it debug mode with "sh -x")


If it still have non zero exit from that script and you believe that
your system is fine, you can put
exit 0
in the beginning of that file (after shebang) and run

dpkg --configure -a

to fix unconfigured packages

I tried that and I get

+ return 1
+ exit 1

At the beginning I get:

no talloc stackframe at ../source3/param/loadparm.c:4864, leaking memory

Which I am concerned about.

I'm with the others -- the problem should be fixable. I've dealt with some messy
upgrade problems at times, but I've *never* had to do a clean install. A problem
with one package should be fixable, even if the fix is tricky...

For what it's worth on backups...

- I'm a fan of automysqlbackup (in the Ubuntu and Debian repositories) for MySQL
backups, which is a wrapper script for mysqldump that compresses, rotates, saves
daily/weekly/monthly versions, notifies on error, etc.

- For filesystem backups, rsnapshot is pretty great for incremental, versioned
backups


Other packages I often install on a clean Ubuntu/Debian server:
- logwatch: log analyser
- fail2ban: ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
- munin: gathers graphs for performance monitoring

Subject: [GTALUG] Swift vs Go vs Python vs Ruby
Message-ID: <557B1194.1070709@mylesbraithwaite.com>

At this week's GTALUG meeting a couple of people asked what Swift looked
like compared to other languages here is an example of a nursery rhyme:

Swift:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.swift>

Go:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.go>

Python:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.py>

Ruby:
<https://github.com/myles/five-little-monkeys/blob/master/five-little-monkeys.rb>

I also mistakenly said that Go and Swift look like Python but Go and
Swift look nothing a like. After some more research I should have said
Go and Swift look the same but take a lot of influence from Python and C.

Cool.

A few weeks ago I was reading about it. Well, not about all the 4, but
about a few differences between Go and Swift, and I found an
interesting article about it. If anyone is interested, there´s a good
reading:

I have a rather weird bit of Linux history, a 90 page VA Linux Systems
Stock Prospectus (November 17, 1999): I actually bought into their
initial public offering - I was living in the U.S. at the time.  It's
all risk assessment and financials.  I'm about to chuck it into the
recycling, but it occurred to me that someone might be interested.  Or
perhaps that's a stretch ... but I'll hold onto it for a few days.
Let me know if you want it.

Well Android is kinda Linux based ....

Now that I can walk from my Bell Mobility contract I am looking to 
unlock my phone.

Free tutorials do not work on my current Android OS version. 4.4.2

I see a number of web sites offering unlocking that cost about $50. That 
is what Bell charges.

I went to a computer outlet store and they quoted $35. Not sure if I get 
a guarantee, so Bell at $50 is still a consideration.

Any and all comments and suggestion most welcome!

Hello Stephen,

I would pay Bell the $50 because if they brick it, there is a chance that they will replace the phone.

Read the Terms and Conditions associated with the unlocking and ask them questions first, however.

(Not sure my reply will make it to the GTA list, so feel free to forward
it).

I never had a phone brick when unlocking it, though I did this 5 or 6
times in recent years.

The way it works is that the unlock company gets your IMEI, and they
send you an unlock code. When you insert your SIM and power on the
phone, it asks for an unlock code, and you just enter it, and that is it.

Sony phones (the brand I use most) costs $29.99 US, and they are among
the most costly to unlock. Other phones cost less.

On Cell Unlocker's web site, you can enter the make/model/carrier and
IMEI and they give you a quote, so you know ahead of time how much it
costs.

Hi all,

My BlackBerry is dying.  So, I'm looking to buy a cheap cell phone out
right for Rogers network.  I don't care about locked, unlocked, Android,
Windows, etc, because my usage is 95% text and 5% voice.

Which brand do you recommend?  CanadaComputers has BLU phones (Android).
Microsoft Stores has them too.  Any feedback on these BLU phones?

Any phone unlocked for $9.99 ( can highly recommend they unlocked a
Blackberry and a Samsung for me took less than 10 mins )

HI William,

There are Blu and Que phones.

QUE: http://queproducts.com/
BLU: http://www.bluproducts.com/index.php/android-phones

Both have Dual SIM, both very decent devices. Price is very affordable.

Flip side is you may not ( or you may ) receive the clarity say of a
Samsung or LG and if shit happens I have no idea what their replacement
policy is or warranties are.

My 2cents both are very solid devices for the price.

Thanks - Aruna

Greetings from the GTALUG branch office in Geneva.

I just bought an LG G4 and am EXTREMELY happy with it. Best phone I've ever
owned. But probably beyond your price expectations.

For what you want I would highly suggest looking at the Moto E, which is
normally $180 from Telus, Koodo, and staples. Canada Computers currently
has it on special for $150
<http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=30_415&item_id=082273>.
Many reviews call it one of the best smartphones at the low end.

You might consider the Nexus 5.  If you've been with Rogers for a while,
you may be able to get one for free.  Back in late 2013, just after the
N5 was released, I was able to get one for $100.  At the moment, they're
"free" with some plans.  So, give Rogers a call and tell them you've
been with them for however long you've been with them and tell them you
want to upgrade.  You may wind up with a free phone, without having to
take out a new plan.  However, it would also be a good time to compare
your current plan with whatever they're offering.  They might be able to
offer a cheaper one etc.

I could have got another phone for free, but I wanted the N5 and am
quite happy with it.

Hmm...  That link timed out.  You'll have to go to the Rogers site and
search on Nexus 5.

Has anyone tried the new Asus Zenphone 2?
http://www.canadacomputers.com/asus/zenfone2.php  (also available at other
stores)  It comes unlocked and I think it works with Wind Mobile.  It's
$250.

The Nexus 4 and 5 are also both very good phones (constant OS updates!).

I'm curious what these phones are like...  "Dual SIM" tells me these are
rebranded Chinese phones, though.

You are a quirky case.  Not meant as an insult -- I'm a quirky case
too.  That probably means you should pay attention to why folks are
making recommendations and not what the actual phone model they
recommend.

As I understand it (and I've not been shopping), all phones sold
through Microsoft Stores are running Windows Phone OS.  Including BLU
models.  If you truly don't care about the OS (and things that go with
it), the Microsoft Store often has very good prices.  And they are
always unlocked (a bonus even if you don't care now).  I care about
the OS and Windows Phone would not be my first choice.

Do you care about a physical keyboard?  BB would seem to be the only game 
in town (probably not strictly true).  And with BB's challenged business, 
my impression is that you can find them at a fairly good price.  You 
probably want to try a keyboard before you buy a phone.

I like the idea of a Nexus 5 but it isn't clear that its strengths
match your desires.  I've been happy with my Nexus 4.

I hate the idea of being tied to a contract in return for a cheap handset 
up front.  So much so that I'm probably blind to the rare cases where it 
is a win.

Random relevant things that I noticed.  I have not looked into them:

I am quite happy with my Motorola Moto-G (unlocked), which runs Android. Got it 
for around $280 pre-tax at Canada Computers in Mississauga.

I also prefer avoiding the Evil Empire.  ;-)

If he's been with Rogers for a few years and hasn't got a phone from
them recently, the Nexus 5 might be available for free.

If he's been with Rogers long enough, he might not have to take out a
contract.  When I got my Nexus 5, I continued on with my existing plan. 
The only restriction was I couldn't get another phone for 3 years.

Again, William should be calling Rogers first, to see what's available,
with both phone and plans, before looking elsewhere.  He might be able
to save money, while getting a phone at no charge.

BTW, my Nexus 5, like all Google Nexus phones, is unlocked.

I have an unlocked Bold 9700 doing nothing which I can give you for 
free.  If you're in a hurry and have a similar phone, you might be able 
to backup your phone and restore it onto the 9700, saving you lots of 
hassle.  No warranty or support, I'll just wipe it and make sure it's 
not password protected.

IMHO, you're much better off going to a Nexus something, or even to a 
modern BB10 or iPhone.  This is only worth it if you're short on time 
and don't want to deal with switching over right now.

I recently got a Blackberry Classic.  I think it is great.

Well on the rogers plan I am on, the plan is $20/month cheaper per line
if you bring your own phone, which makes buying an unlocked phone cheaper
than getting it from rogers in my case.  Only some of their plans have
that option, others you are always paying the surcharge of getting
subsidised phones and in the end you are always overpaying for it.

My wife has a nxeus 5.  I have tried using it a few times, and honestly
I hate touch screen keyboards, I have how android tries to be helpful
when you don't want it to, and I hate how inconsistent it is in where
you have to go to do things.  I also hate how slow it is to respond to
the 'click' to take pictures with the camera, once you even find how to
get to the stupid camara app.  This is a large part of why I do NOT have
an android phone myself.

I tried out a few of the blackberrys at a rogers store to see what
tehy were like to work with, and was instantly a lot more impressed
than any android device I have ever dealt with.  It is just so much
more consistent.  And it doesn't try to second guess what you want to do.

I do not appreciate being redirected to the gmail app if I start a
browser and go to gmail.com.  I especially don't appreciate having to
add my account to do a quick email check on an android device, and then
having to figure out that to remove the account again you have to go to
account management, not to where you added the account in the first place.
@#$@#$ morons designed this thing.

Note that I've been stuck with second hand phones since forever, and I
don't really have experience with any of the suggested models.

The Nokia Lumia is well sized, and of reasonable speed and thickness. It
runs Windows~  Also, pretty colours. Why not?

One plus. Android, and generally awesome. You can only obtain it on
Tuesdays I believe. Under three hundred and it's gorgeous as hell.

Of course there are the mainstream ones like the galaxies and notes, and
the Apple. They don't really fit the 'cheap price' part, but I would never
really advise against them.

This is my 3rd BlackBerry.  First was flip phone Pearl, and the hinge
came loose.  Second was Bold 9700, and two of its keys came off.  Third
is Bold 9780, and screen is showing problems and reboot is required
sometimes.  I'll look for some other brand, this time.

Greetings from the
​GTALUG ​
Geneva bureau.
​
(The "G" does stand for "greater", doesn't it?)​


I have a question deriving from my current task at hand, and I'm wondering
if anyone here can help.

Does anyone have any information, lists, research, etc on what companies
hire or contract teleworkers (ie, people not required to be physically
present at the office to do the work)?

This is different from telecommuting, where you have a local job but can
work from home. I mean companies that are into hiring software developers,
customer service reps, etc from other countries. (in my context, I'm
specifically looking for those willing to hire talented people working out
of refugee camps who are, for various reasons, bound to their current
locations.)

Any help at all, directly or to pointers, is appreciated. Apologies to
those who realize this isn't Linux specific.

Thanks!

Did you try to look for something on upwork.com (old odesk.com)? They
(many companies) are always looking for people to work (no matter from
where).

 Nowadays slavery doesn't only come in the obvious form in which one person owns another person (which is traditionally called 'chattel slavery'). Other practices that amount to slavery are:
Bonded labour or debt bondage
    
   - This is when a person's work is the security for a debt - effectively the person has not been sold, but they are on 'a long lease' which they cannot bring to an end, and so cannot leave their 'employer'
   - The conditions of employment can be such that the labourer can't pay off their debt and is stuck for life, because of low wages, deductions for food and lodging, and high interest rates
   - The debt may be inherited by other family members who are then themselves forced into bonded labour
   - Many children become bonded labour because of family poverty - one estimate put the number of children in bonded labour in India alone at 15 million at the end of the 20th century
   - Migrant workers often become bonded labour to pay off those who smuggled them to the new country - they dare not break free for fear of being deported
   - The UN Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery put the total number of people in debt bondage around the world at about 20 million in 1998

​Hi Brent,

Please explain what you mean, and how at all it relates to my question.
Meanwhile, I include my day-job .sig below, so you might better understand
the context. I am looking for livelihoods, not exploitation -- and
certainly not sloganeering.

Please have a look at this:

And this: http://www.samasource.org/

( It's a worthy cause so what the hell... and one can always install Linux
I suppose :)

Good luck - Aruna

I'm not sure the willingness of hiring people in refuge camps, but
stackoverflow careers allows you to filter by listings that allow people to

I'm not really familiar with the typical set up in a refuge camp, but is
there reliable resources required for doing remote work?  Things such as
electricity and Internet access.  Or would people need to trek to the
closest city?

Concerns about modern slavery aren't sloganeering, they are real and they
may begin by offering the most impoverished among us Pyrrhic employment. It
looks good on paper but in fact there is no fair contract.

Remember when one of your partners in Starnix called me a welfare bum on
this list. This was after I had requested a fair contract and nobody would
talk to me about it. You guys recruited me from my volunteering with CLUE.
Offered me a job and when I sought fairness through due process here in
Canada, you terminated me.

It took me five years to get T4 documents after both the ministry of labor
and revenue decided I was an employee for the duration of my employment.
Starnix still owes me one T4 and a separation certificate but I didn't have
the mental health resources to bang my head against that wall for another
five years.

So my data point is; what is going to stop similar harassment and abuse of
dominance of other similar at risk workers in the global telecommuting
environment?

Respectfully,

​There is no typical camp, and no typical refugee. Some of the people
fleeing violence at home are already well educated. And some settlements
have more reliable utilities -- and thus are more suited for telework --
than others.​

Or would people need to trek to the closest city?

​Not a matter of trekking; some of the refugee centres managed by UNHCR are
located in urban areas​. I was at one in Kampala last week.

You said that you were looking for people to hire teleworkers situated in refugee camps who were bound to their locations.

For starters, how does this scheme prevent refoulment?‎ (ie The return of a refugee to their persecutors.)

​Not so much bound, but unable to legally work outside the settlement. Some
refugee environments have more hospitable hosts than others.​

​The "scheme" is primarily a training and Internet-access program designed
to equip people to make a living in what is often a hostile environment.​
One of the options in the most-hostile areas -- when local work simply
isn't available -- is telework. At this point I am exploring the most
suitable skills for those seeking that path, as well as the companies
willing to hire/contract people with such skills.

​The UNHCR takes
refugee security​
very seriously; in fact it considers itself primarily a protection agency
first,
​ ​
a livelihood-finding org
​third (after education)​
.
​And refoulment is high on the list of concerns. ​
Everything I am doing is vetted by the internal protection unit with
exactly
​such issues​
 in mind.
​ The program I am involved with has already implemented a number of
security measures (mainly in the realm of privacy protection) along these
lines, supervised ​by people far better versed in the subject than I. Other
issues that are addressed include protection against gender-based violence
in environments where education (and Internet access) for women can put
them (and the education/computer centres) at risk. All this and more is
being addressed and guides all that we do.


This may not completely address your question, but it's as good as I can
get -- I'm not sure I can do anything utterly risk-free, but doing nothing
is worse.

Cheers,
Evan

I don't recall a talk on MediaWiki any time vaguely recently; that's an in
principle
interesting thing.  I've used it over the years, have seen some interesting
patterns.
Haven't used it much lately (aside from access of ubiquitous Wikipedia!),
if there's
interesting new stuff, that's neat.

I'd anticipate a challenge in talking of MediaWiki being that it's so open
to
varying use cases that there'll be a few too many strong opinions on how it
ought
to be used.  Holding tenaciously to a specified agenda will be important!

Dear List,

I am a new and green Ubuntu laptop owner in the GTA, and am wondering if 
you could recommend a b/w laser printer (preferably USB-wired) that 
would work smoothly with Ubuntu.  As I discovered, my Lexmark E232 (that 
works beautifully with my Macs) is not (at all) Ubuntu-liked...

With many thanks in advance,

The Free Software Foundation's H-Node has a database of compatible hardware (not
sure how up-to-date it is with current models):
https://h-node.org/printers/catalogue/en

The Linux Foundation has a printer listing database too:
https://www.openprinting.org/printers/

ThinkPenguin sells a few as well (though they only ship to the US):
https://www.thinkpenguin.com/catalog/printer-all-one-gnulinux


I usually see what's available in store, and then cross-reference with those
databases. Though after some frustration with my last purchase (HP LaserJet
P1005), I might go in the reverse direction next time and pick a fully
compatible (and non-tracking) printer from h-node and then see if I can buy it
online...

I'm using Linux Mint with a Brother HL-2170 monochrome printer and a
Brother MFC-9125CN on a home network. The 9125 scanner works from
SimpleScan.

One advantage of Brother printers is that replacement toner is available
from (relatively) low-cost suppliers through Canada Computers.

I haven't done an exhaustive test of the functions but the basics of
printing seem to work correctly.

I had endless problems until I realized that the router was periodically
re-assigning the IP addresses of the printers. Once I fixed that they've
been working properly.

I have Brother HL-2170W (wireless), with "HP LaserJet Series PCL 6 CUPS"
driver.  I think OP's problem is more of "driver" issue, because it
works with Slackware and CUPS.

Lexmark printers are known to be bricks with Linux, and I have a
Lexmark brick myself.

I've had good luck with Samsung laser printers, both colour and B&W.
You need to install a (non-free(dom)) driver, and ensure the parallel
port daemon is removed (CPU hog), but otherwise Samsung printers work
fine.

I've had success with Brother laser printers (B&W multifunction units)
too.

I run one at http://sobac.com/wiki but I'm no Mediawiki expert. I
followed the recipe in the docs, and once it was working I left it
alone. I've made a few small tweaks in the config.php file, and every
time I upgrade I need to adjust the paths to executables, plugins, &c.
(because the standalone installation file/folder layout differs from
the repository layout).

I'll offer my two cents at a presentation, but I'm not sufficiently
skilled to make a presentation.

Once upon a time I had a lexmark colour laser printer that worked OK with
Linux, but the cartridges cost a Vast Fortune and you had to buy them from
Lexmark.

I gave it away and bought the Brother printers I'm using now. They seem to
work fine.

Another plus for the Brother laser printers is that *most* of them have
a reliable duplex unit, so you can print double sided without grief.

Generally, I buy by brand since the model numbers change so much. Within
brands, I try to find sources (such as Consumer Reports) that measure
objective criteria such as cost-per-page and sharpness.

I have never gone wrong with Brother or HP. HP support for Linux is more
full-featured <http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html>, especially
if you can use an Internet connection rather than USB, but it occasionally
contains closed-source bits for some cheaper models. Brother support is
more vanilla but pretty solid.

I have heard from associates having success with Samsung printers under
Linux but have no first hand experience.

On the other side are brands to avoid, that are indifferent at best to
Linux and hostile at worst. These are Canon and Lexmark.

‎Hi Evan.
‎Why not get more camp involvement?

I think the telenetworking initiative may be more successful if the camp is involved, drives, and  buys-into the entire life cycle especially the front-end  (e.g. positioning, marketing, sales, presentations, music, speeches, videos, etc.)

Ie Raw camp led initiatives may reach people in a way that polished initiatives can not reach people .

If timed properly (following housing, food, water, sewage, medical, internal governance, mail) such initiatives might reduce internal crime, vandalism, ‎conflict, etc and provide the entire camp with opportunities and hope.

Greetings from the
​GTALUG ​
Geneva bureau.
​
(The "G" does stand for "greater", doesn't it?)​


I have a question deriving from my current task at hand, and I'm wondering
if anyone here can help.

Does anyone have any information, lists, research, etc on what companies
hire or contract teleworkers (ie, people not required to be physically
present at the office to do the work)?

This is different from telecommuting, where you have a local job but can
work from home. I mean companies that are into hiring software developers,
customer service reps, etc from other countries. (in my context, I'm
specifically looking for those willing to hire talented people working out
of refugee camps who are, for various reasons, bound to their current
locations.)

Any help at all, directly or to pointers, is appreciated. Apologies to
those who realize this isn't Linux specific.

Thanks!

Lumping these problems with food, water and basic essentials risk making 
the problem unmanageably complex.  I expect given Evan's background, 
he's focusing on the areas where he can make the most impact.

There are people who are talented contractors who would normally be 
knowledge workers outside the camp, who's skills aren't being used and 
risk irrelevance while they're stuck there.

Evan, does that sum up your target audience for this?

If I were looking for info on this, I would seriously consider doing 
some lightning talks in the European FOSS and hacker conference 
circuits.  Lots of European hackers play with the digital nomad 
lifestyle and might be able to help.  It's hard to know how it would be 
received.  I would expect that you're likely to get a lot of good names 
and good volunteers, some who may have lived through the experience. 
The Chaos Camp is on this year near Berlin.  Let me know if you head out 
there, I might be in the neighbourhood :-)

Another spot to ask might be Telcom Sans Frontieres, they may have 
people who have insight into local talent during crisis.  I expect you 
probably already bent their ears though.  I have a friend who may have 
contacts there.

Other than the above $.02, I'm clueless on the subject.

You might want to read "ThinkPad: A Different Shade of Blue".  I read
this book in the fall of 1999, when I was working at IBM and asked the
librarian there to get a copy.

I get plenty of private mail so I don't know what happened to Brent's.

I really don't want to get too far afield, and I appreciate all the tips
and pointers from those who did answer my question helpfully. I won't have
the bandwidth to offer many more answers. But there is one comment to be
made.

Brent's "help" hasn't hasn't been helpful at all, and I am replying
publicly because there are lessons within. I asked for assistance with A
and get in return volunteer advice on B; that seems to happen often in
Linux forums. But in this case, the advice was grounded in assumptions (ie,
about crime and vandalism) that are baseless and borderline racist.

Refugee settlements are not ethnic ghettos. They mix colours, tribes and
religions, generally in peace. What their residents share, for the most
part, is having been through absolute hell; for some of them the choice was
"live in a community or die alone". They have every reason to be bitter,
angry or resigned, but those I met were none of that.

That's not to say all is well. There was a hanging one morning during the
time I was at the settlement; the victim was identified as a spy for a
government that people were running away from, and not a resident of the
settlement. I saw the body after it was cut down; I was told this was not a
common occurrence.

Nothing that I or any other do-gooder helper can do is going to eliminate
THAT kind of conflict through rich-world "community building" exercises.
Based on what I saw, people running away from atrocity can sometimes teach
us more about community and cohesion and sharing than we could ever teach
them. (I heard the word "Ubuntu" used in context that had nothing to do
with Linux.)

So... if you didn't have advice for what I asked, that's cool, it was a
fairly specialized request. But please, think twice before using the
request to indulge in gratuitous "why don't we just...." commentary. It's
an unhelpful distraction that betrays bias more than it offers help.

To echo all the other posters I have had great experience with Brother printers
via USB and ethernet. The only other brand I would consider is HP if I wanted
to take a chance.

I have a Brother printer/scanner too ( MFC-J6510 ). I'll admit it works 
well, when the drivers are installed properly.

Unfortunately the drivers have to be downloaded as a script from the 
manufacturer, and I've found it a little buggy, requiring some tweaking 
after the fact to get it all working. For a newbie I'd probably 
recommend something else. Not sure what though, I haven't installed any 
other printer drivers recently.

Re-read the thread from the beginning. Where exactly are the assumptions
about crime and vandalism except in casual relation to the dynamics of a
life in conflict.

Most especially point out just exactly the borderline racisim is in that
thread. His thread was modern slavery which is about abuse of dominance and
creating a culture of hope therein.

So... if you didn't have advice for what I asked, that's cool, it was a

request to indulge in gratuitous "why don't we just...." commentary. It's
an unhelpful distraction that betrays bias more than it offers help.

You bashed the guy with your UN creds, while fishing for more specialized
information for your own needs and now do it again in this email by
alluding to nonexistent borderline racism.

Gotta hand it to you that's real chutzpah.

I think it has to do with the fact that emails sent to the list retain the
"from:" of the original sender but have a "reply-to:" to the mailing list.
So it depends on the UI used for emails, but it's pretty easy to hit
"reply" to an email from the mailing list and think you're making a private
reply when it actually sends the email to the mailing list.  I think I may
have done that myself...  ;)

As a footnote to all this philadelphia, Brother printers can be a bit of
a pain for non-x86 systems. The scanners on their MFCs are essentially
paperweights on anything but Intel.

We use HP printers at our place ( Deskjet 3050a J11 series, HP Photosmart c 4700 series , HP Deskjet 5700) and they co-operate well on  our network of three Linux boxes (2 Fedora 21 and one Linuxmint17) ant three Windows 7 computers. HP does a great job on Linux support.

Any major distro has hplip in the repos. Go HP. It always works. Anything
else is a gamble whether you'll have drivers or an expensive paper weight.

HP may do a good job on printer support but support for their own brand 
scanners is a bit lacking.

The devil is in the details.

You cannot completely judge a printer's support by its brand.

Example: I've had two (older) Lexmark printers that were well
supported.  And yet you say that your Lexmark E232 isn't supported.

Example: I've had a lot of random inexpensive Brother printers that
were well-supported with open-source drivers (PCL6 and sometimes
PostScript).  I was surprised and disappointed to find a brother MFC
that I bought actually required closed source drivers (but at least
they exist and work).

Some printers outsource page imaging to the host computer.  Some of
those use proprietary protocols.  Some of those are not documented and
are not reverse-engineered, so CUPS cannot support them.  It is very
hard to tell from the printer's documentation whether this is the
case.  Looking up the printer on the databases previously mentioned is
the thing to do.

Some manufacturers produce closed-source drivers for some models of
their printers.  That's useful but:

- how long will support continue?

- will support work on your distro?

- support is likely x86-only

- it is annoying to have to go through a driver installation process
  every time you install a new Linux distro or try to use the
  printer from a new machine (each machine on the network that
  can access the printer)

When it comes to scanners and MFC devices, support is more spotty.
Again, look up the SANE database to find out if Linux support exists
for a particular scanner (or scanner part of MFC).

(So far, Brother's support for my MFC has been pretty good.)

Uncalled for recommendations:

- duplex printing (ability to print on both sides of the paper) is
  something I will not do without

- I like network printing (but security depends on all threats being
  from outside your network because the printer trusts stuff on the
  LAN).

  + for security reasons, I don't like wireless printers.  But I
    haven't looked into how printers actually deal with this issue.

  + It is nice to not have to turn on a particular computer to print.

  + It is nice to not have to wire a printer to a laptop.

- Consider getting an MFC (combo printer-scanner)

  + it is nice to have a scanner.  Especially one with an Automatic
    Document Feeder.

  + Some MFCs are very inexpensive.  For example, Brothers' sometimes
    go on sale for ~$100.

  + downside: MFCs are big and awkward

  + downside: MFC toner cartridges seem to be smaller and thus more
    expensive per page than cartridges for some printers.

Some companies are good at providing drivers for their devices for Windows, 
Mac, and sometimes x86 based Linux. However, if you are doing something with 
embedded systems that have a different processor (ie. an ARM based one), 
closed source drivers mean you are out of luck as far as using the device.

Hi,

Every few days I've started to get my notebook's network connection
giving out. This is what the log tells me:

 [Sat Jun 27 17:14:38 2015] wlan0: deauthenticated from
00:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (Reason: 7=CLASS3_FRAME_FROM_NONASSOC_STA)

 [Sat Jun 27 17:14:38 2015] cfg80211:   (2457000 KHz - … etc.

Restarting network-manager often fixes it, but not always.

This is on Ubuntu 15.04, x86_64. Network card is Intel Centrino
Advanced-N 6235, which may well be part of the problem.

I realize that there's more info I should add, but short of dumping all
of /etc on you, I don't know what else would be useful.

cheers,
 Stewart

My past experience with HP printers has been that they print beautifully 
but the mechanicals crap out after a very short time, after which one 
has to feed/unfeed the paper by hand.  I've spent untold hours feeding 
my HP printers, and am uneager to repeat the experience.  But perhaps 
they have become better in recent years?
