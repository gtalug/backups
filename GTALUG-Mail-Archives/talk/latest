512kb is a very long key :-)

Temporary key?  You mean the key generated by the DH exchange?  The
normal term is "ephemeral".

I don't understand U of T's email systems.  I connect to the Department of 
Computer Science servers sometimes.  I think that they are run by DCS.  
There was a big fight last year or so in which the university outsourced 
email to google (I think; horrible for privacy).  Are you talking to a 
departmental server or a university-wide server?

In any case, they should be easily shamed into upgrading.

I had outbound problems, some very similar to yours

If all else fails, you don't have to actually be a spammer (and
I'm not) but "SendGrid" will punch your ticket for free if you
send less than 400 emails a day. 

They seem able to send anything to anybody with access to the
disposition of the email if you should need it.

Looking at inbound headers  too, I notice a couple of well known
reputable companies using SendGrid.

Yes, I feel it's the same way. Bluetooth was all screwed up under
Utopic, too. I need both, and only under Ubuntu do the two not play

I have an HP Laserjet 1012. It prints 8.5x11 like a dream. Flawlessly
compatible with Ubuntu, connecting directly via USB.

http://www.amazon.com/HP-Q2461A-ABA-LaserJet-Printer/dp/B0000C1XHY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435768875&sr=8-1&keywords=laserjet+1012

It's a bit pricey on Amazon, mainly because it is discontinued and still
very popular. The PRO P1102w may be the replacement. It is also a USB
printer:

http://www.amazon.com/HP-CE657A-BGJ-LaserJet-P1102w/dp/B0036TGGVO/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1435768959&sr=1-5&keywords=hp+laserjet&refinements=p_n_feature_five_browse-bin%3A5662328011

I have tested the European model, it works perfectly. Not sure if the North
American version will work the same. I guess it should.

DCS runs their own systems for CS students, and occasionally for engineers:
http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/

This is very different and totally separate from the general systems that U of T
runs. About 4 or 5 years back, U of T deprecated their only UTORmail system,
which they ran internally, for "UTMail+", which is Microsoft. They were forcing
people to migrate, first students, then clubs, not sure if/when staff accounts
were forced over.

I use the UTMail+ IMAP/SMTP servers with no problem from Icedove/Thunderbird...
and I've been doing this for a decade, through the transition from UTORmail to
UTMail+... though I've never tried from Postfix.

With UTMail+, my SMTP server is pod51008.outlook.com (or something like that).
With UTORmail, it was smtp.utoronto.ca or something with extra numbers. (I never
used CDF SMTP... I just had my CDF account forward mail to my UTORmail account...)

I guess it would help to know what system (or SMTP server) in particular you're
using?

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC4QruLrZe+20vxsmMrSLdfFi8vTi7Yb3664yzeRC-DOfA@mail.gmail.com>

I have this idea that's been slowly forming in my head.  I wanted to
run it by TLUG for opinions to find out if I'm totally crazy or if it
might work.

I hope to set up my desktop (and probably my laptop as well) to have a
Debian stable base OS - about as stripped as I can manage, just X with
a lightweight window manager (probably OpenBox).  On top of that would
be VirtualBox, the idea being to run all my applications from virtual
machines.

Since I'd have multiple machines accessing the same /home/, I'd want
NFS.  That could be run by the host OS, but I was thinking about using
OpenWRT as the NFS server.  But that immediately runs into a
difficulty: it appears that getting the VirtualBox Guest Additions
running in OpenWRT is (very?) difficult, so I'd probably have to use
raw partition access.  The problem with that is that if the partition
is accessed simultaneously by any application on the host OS, you can
munge the partition.

I'm also planning on running another OpenWRT instance: this would be
used for routing, with all the other virtual machines going through it
to access the outside world.  Among other things, that would mean I
only have to administer a firewall in one place.  One idea I'm still
considering is giving full control of the network card to the OpenWRT
instance and making the host OS go through OpenWRT to get to the
outside world ...

This could all probably be done with KVM rather than VirtualBox, but I
prefer VB not only because I'm more familiar with it, but also because
.VDI disc images can vary in size (Qemu's .qcow2 image format are
fixed size) and because VirtualBox handles full screen display of OSes
better (at least once Guest Additions is installed).  I'm happy to
listen to reasons in favour of KVM.

Other virtual machines would include TinyCore, SliTaz, and Debian
Stretch.  The latter would probably be my primary OS.  The thought was
to ssh from the host OS to the guest with X forwarding, and then run a
launcher from the guest on the host so any applications run from the
launcher were from the guest.

Advantages:
- I get to tinker with multiple OSes (something I enjoy)
- if I'm about to go to a dubious website, I can clone a virtual
machine, use it for the dubious visit, then destroy it

Disadvantages that I've thought of so far:
- memory usage
- speed reduction
- hard drive usage for disk images
- complexity
- mounting USB sticks on guests is extremely problematic
- playing sound/video from guests through the host is imperfect
- hard to determine where an application is running from

I'm sure there are many, many other problems with this idea.  Go to
town, that's why I'm here.

So, /home is in VM as well?  I didn't know VirtualBox can boot
OpenWRT... if it can boot Linux ISO, then I guess it should also boot
OpenWRT ISO file.

You can run VirtualBox VM in "Bridged Adapter" network mode.  That will
expose the VMs to the outside.  This means, the VMs will get separate
IPs from external router/modem, just like your host.  VirtualBox has few
other network modes, ie. NAT Network, Internal Network, Host-only
Adapter.

For "bridge" mode, VirtualBox is much easier.  It's one mouse click.
With QEMU, you have to create bridge, attach interface to it, and run VM
with "helper" to attach its network card to it.  It's about 5 extra
command lines.

If you know those command lines, then it's one script.  So, it's even, I
guess.  :-)

Main disadvantage.  2GB for each VMs and host, plus head room.

Yes.  Even with 8-core AMD, it just chokes.  Maybe Intel i7 is better.

I found VirtualBox handles USB much better than QEMU.  But, still, both
are flaky and hangs frequently.

It doesn't address all your proposed scenarios but you might want to check
out LXC containers for generating lightweight virtual machines... I have
just started messing around with it and found these links to be interesting:

Hey top posting from an email that isn't able to post to tlug ... feel
free to forward this link to the list if you like:

https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/

Using docker's volumes feature to bind mount directories and files into
a container allows things like running Xorg, with persistent writes to
shared files. No NFS needed even.

I don't have a permanent fix yet, but the brute-force method of issuing

	sudo /etc/init.d/network-manager restart

makes the network come back. For a while, at least.

Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1507052243240.2272@redclaw.mimosa.com>

This story could be told in order of discovery.  That would be more fun.  
But I'm going to explain it as plainly as possible to make it more useful.

I have a KVM switch (Keyboard Video Mouse) that lets four computers share 
one keyboard, display, and mouse.

Unbeknownst to me, the keyboard started generating a rapid stream of ESC [ 
D (back arrow) sequences.  I'm not sure whether it is all the time or just 
some of the time.

The next time I booted one of the computers, it seemed to fail to find its 
hard drives.  It was more than a decade old, so rather than fixing it, I 
replaced it.  I now think that a continuous stream of backarrow keys 
confused the BIOS (or the RAID card BIOS) when the machine was booting.  
But at that time, it seemed to be a simple case of old hardware wearing 
out.

Another computer had different symptoms, but again showed disk problems.  
When I did disk diagnostics, I was puzzled by the results: no problem.

Eventually, I found the keyboard problem and have thrown the keyboard 
away.  I have no idea how long it had been misbehaving.

Lessons re-learned: 

- symptoms don't always point clearly to the disease.

- conclusions should remain provisional

- it's amazing how long you can overlook a stuck keyboard key

- apparently I really only use the KVM for booting; it would be
  nice if PCs had been designed to be happy headless

Many are.  Check the BIOS (or whatever it's called these days) settings.

In older days (a few generations of PC ago) there used to be a BIOS setting 
where you could tell it to ignore keyboard errors. You would enable that 
feature if you wanted to run the computer without a keyboard. I haven't 
looked to see if such a feature still exists in modern day BIOS but I don't 
see why they would have removed the option unless it will ignore keyboard 
errors automatically.

I have 4 computers here, one with a year old motherboard.  3 of them can
run headless and the other, an old Compaq, I just leave an old keyboard
plugged in, but still access it via KVM.


Like I said, check the settings.

Before I got a PC, I had Sun workstations.  They were willing to talk
via a serial port to a "console" (they could use a display and
keyboard too).  This let you do things like reboot when hung, watch
all the exciting messages during booting, configure the machine, run
hardware diagnostics, etc.

I don't really want to lose those functions.  On PCs, they seem to
require a console (or some quite expensive "management" features).
That's why I use a KVM (and grumble).

I think that the expensive management functions use ethernet
transport.  For security, it ought to be separate from other networks.
I have no experience with them.  Unfortuately, I think that the
protocols are proprietary and different for each brand of computer.

KVMs are either expensive or deficient.  Or both.

- cheap ones only support VGA, a very obsolete standard

- some cheap KVMs don't pass DDC info so the OS cannot determine
  characteristics of the monitor.  This causes a variety of problems
  (some modern Linux distros won't work out of the box with this).

- some better cheap KVMs pass DDC information, but only to the
  computer currently selected.  This works badly after a power failure
  when each computer is rebooting at the same time.

- there are issues (that I don't understand) about keyboard and mouse
  states carrying over on switching.

- I have another KVM that is normally sold for ~$500 that does a lot
  right: support dual-link DVI, does pass DDC to all computers.  I
  paid $100, so that was a great choice.  Even so, it gets a bit
  confused by some mice.

HDMI switches are quite cheap these days.  That would handle the V
part of KVM.  Maybe the clutter of multiple keyboards and mice would
be OK.  HDMI includes an ethernet signal now.  Someone should build a
pair of dongles to ship K and M stuff over that channel.  USB over
ethernet is probably already a thing.

I have a KVM that does HDMI and USB, so video, keyboard, mouse and even
audio are switched.  As I said, the one computer requires a keyboard
plugged in, but all work through the KVM.

Nice!  What is the brand and model of the KVM?

USB doesn't count as a keyboard?  Or is it that the switch doesn't
"fake" the keyboard and mouse for the unselected computers?  In that
case, it would look to the computer as if the mouse and keyboard were
plugged in each time the computer were selected and unplugged each
time it is deselected.

I have a USB KVM switch that switches auxiliary USB but for USB
keyboard and mouse sockets fakes them for the unselected computers.

It appears the KVM doesn't "fake" a keyboard, so I have to plug a real
keyboard into that one computer.  All the rest work fine as is, after
configuring the CMOS so that the computer will boot without a keyboard. 
I haven't noticed any issues with not having a mouse plugged in, but
then a mouse isn't usually critical for using a computer.  Back in the
days before GUIs, we usually didn't even own a mouse.

The massive HP printer/scanner/copier we had in the office a few years
ago was a disaster.  The thing it did best was paper jams.  Dozens of
paper jams every day.

The canon that replaced it has almost never had a paper jam.

Of course those are not models you would use at home, but given they
do postscript and IPP network printing, they work great with linux
(for printing, scanning is a different story).

Well I pretty much never have any reason to scan anything, and they are

Because Firefox kept locking up and various other things were out of date,
I decided to upgrade to the latest version of Linux Mint. The upgrade
seemed to work but resulted in a blank desktop, so I decided a complete
re-install was required.

So I backed up the /home directory to an external USB hard drive,
programmed a USB key with a Mint .iso and booted up into the latest Mint.

That went fine. Then I tried to restore the backup of the home directory,
the computer announced that it couldn't read the file, something about
'bad superblock', which is enough to bring one's heart to a complete and
utter stop. *Fortunately*, bumping against the USB cable got it working,
and I think the problem was a bad connector.

OK, piece of cake from here on, right? Then in the process of moving files
from the backup to my home directory, I forgot that I was in superuser
mode and ~ was shorthand for /root. That made a mess, and in the process
of sorting out that, I moved the /bin directory. So of course, no commands
worked at all. (This reminds me of the scenario where someone executes rm
-rf * in superuser mode and only discovers the mistake when the computer
announces: rm command not found. I know someone who actually did that.
(Not me ;) ). Arrrgh.

So I decided that the simplest route was to re-install.

Then, for some reason, the USB key wouldn't boot. Fortunately, an old
Knoppix CD did boot, establishing that boot from CD was still working. So
I prevailed on my friend Gabriel to burn me an .iso on DVD, and that
worked.

So, to my colleagues in TLUG, I ask: How would you deal with the
re-location of /bin, assuming you didn't want to re-install?

    If you keep /home on a separate partition, you wouldn't have this problem.

Sorry - - - scanning is quite useful for me and I sure would like a
way to make it work connected to my Linux box!

Haven't had much luck so far.

That too makes sense.

If you read the critical reviews on newegg, it looks as if the monitor
doesn't make EDID information about the monitor work for unselected
computers.  This can cause problems.  Perhaps not for old fashioned
text consoles (like BIOS setup screens).

=============

I went googling for interesting KVMs and came up with this:
<http://www.amazon.com/Displayport-Switch-Control-Desktop-Product/dp/B00V5I0QLE>

Amazon describes it as a 12-port DisplayPort KVM!

Unfortunately, the manufacturer says you can connect two PC to it, no
more.

I got tired of hunting for unicorns.  Not only are KVMs that match my
requirements rare and expensive, it is hard to identify them amongst
the descriptions of inferior products.

Here's a useful document from Microsoft:
<http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/E/7/7E7662CF-CBEA-470B-A97E-CE7CE0D98DC2/KVM-Win7.docx>
It deals only with video issues.  Apparently there is/was a "Windows
Logo Program" for KVM switches.  I don't remember ever seeing a
Windows logo on a KVM, but I would take it as a Good Thing.
Oh, it seems that the logo program was retired "with the release of
the Windows Logo Kit (WLK) for Windows Server 2008 RTM."  Darn.

Hmm, hadn't realized you were still stuck.

In your /etc/sane.d/ folder, there should be a .conf file for your
scanner. Mine is different from yours, but the relevant lines look like
this (from epson2.conf):

 # Detect all devices supported by the backend.
 # If you don't have a SCSI device, you can comment out the "scsi"
 # keyword.  Similarly for the other keywords.
 #
 usb
 scsi
 net 192.168.2.68

You need to set the 'net' entry to the IP address of your scanner.
(You can ping your printer, yes? I mean, if it's not even seen on the
network, you have to address this first. You're also using an x86 or
x86_64 Linux box, yes? Scanner binary support for ARM is mostly no go,
so Raspberry Pis are right out.)

For good measure, I have $SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE set to:

 epson2:net:192.168.2.68

Your scanner might use the brscan or brscan2 driver, so you'll be
looking for something like /etc/sane.d/brscan*conf. Also, your scanner
backend needs to be listed in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf for sane to find it.

The 'sane-find-scanner' tool may not find your scanner, but with me,
xsane does. With that environment variable set, you can then do
something like this:

 scanimage > blort.pbm

to scan the page at 75 dpi, b&w.

If all of that doesn't work, you may have to resort to scanning to a
network share. I think that the MFC-J6510DW shares its memory card using
CIFS. Stick an SD in the scanner, browse your network, and see what you
find.

This latter option is by no means bad: I've used it to scan thousands of
pages of bank statements and other receipts. You don't get a tonne of
control over the scan format, but it's quick.

If even all this fails, it's telephone support, I'm afraid. It's so much
cheaper to provide this than e-mail support, and that's why Brother are
so keen on it.

cheers,
 Stewart

Something that uses standard IETF-ish protocols over a network is
more likely to work than something that expects to do something
proprietary directly to a Windows box or Mac.

I've got a Brother MFC set up to drop scans (PDF or JPG) into a Samba
share on my fileserver, so that's quite compatible.

And I've looked at a big Canon printer very much like the one Lennart
has, and it seemed to use SMTP and LDAP, but someone would have to run
out of better things to do before poking at that.

Something I've wondered about doing this:
/home doesn't only contain data files created by the user. There are
also many hidden files created by the system and programs, usually in
the root of the user's home directory. For example: .config and
.gconf.

If one were to install a new distribution, or even just a newer
release of the same distribution, and then simply re-mount the /home
partition afterwards, might not there possibly be some problems with
these hidden files containing incorrect information? Do most programs
that create these files sort things out for themselves?

I have kept /home on a separate partition for as long as I can remember. 
Makes an upgrade much easier.

Programs find their .conf files and continue as before the upgrade.

Never an issue with permissions.

Of course if you change your user name, there will be issues :)

In theory it should be the program's problem: you're a loyal user
who's been using their product for a while, the program should
recognize and convert/update from previous formats.

In practice it's hit-and-miss: one of my favourite window managers,
wmii, breaks its old ~/.wmii/... file formats every couple years and I
have to wipe them, learn the new format, and re-configure.  It sucks.
It depends on the program.  I remember having to do it once long ago
(like a decade) with KDE, but mostly the big names play nice these
days.

| In theory it should be the program's problem: you're a loyal user

I've worried about the same problem.  And a variant: sometimes I have
several distros on the same machine and I'd love to share /home.  I
don't do it because I don't trust it to work.

I even worry about sharing /home between different releases of the
same distro.  Going forward seems to mostly work.  I don't know about
going backward.

I wish that the . files were it some place other than ~.  Or that
there was some other solution.

Some of my . files are universal, for all systems (eg. .joverc).
Others are specific, often in ways I don't even understand.  For
example, what's .dbus? .cache?  What's in .gnome2 and .gnome2_private?

$PATH says how to search for executables.  Perhaps we need something
like that for searching for . files (ending with /etc/skel?).

Just move /bin back to original location. :-)  I'm sure there was reason
for not able to that.  Other than that, 
    - keep /home in separate partition, as Chris suggested.
    - keep backup.  I do 4 complete cron backups (hourly, daily, weekly,
      and monthly), and 1 manual backup (electrically disconnected).  It
      used to be the other way around, 1 cron and 4 manual, but I got
      tired of swapping harddisks.

In the heat of the moment, I thought of PATH as something one changes by
editing configuration files, but yeah, you can simply type in a new one.
Good to remember.

I also didn't realize that some commands are built into the shell, so some
things remain possible even if bin isn't reachable.

I know it's not the Unix Way, but an 'undo' button would be nice for these
situations.

If you knew where /bin wound up I would just move it back. If it said it 
can't find 'mv' I could type /path/to/bin/mv to move the wandering /bin back 
to its normal home. If that failed I always keep bootable Linux discs on 
hand. I have a CD case that holds 6 discs and it has the last couple of 
versions of the Linux live/install DVD's I've used along with some other 
useful discs such as tomsrtbt.

I just completed updating my system from Linux Mint 17 (32-bit) to Linux 
Mint 17.2 (64-bit). My /home is in a separate partition and I have four 20G 
partitions that I use as root partitions. One of the four is the current 
system root, another is a backup of root from the last time I was about to 
do an update/upgrade of the distro and the other 2 can be used to try out 
other Linux distros (if I have the time and/or interest to try something 
different).

The separate /home meant that my user account wasn't affected. After the 
install was complete I just logged in to my user account as always and got 
back to work. Well, after the usual need to sort out a minor issue or three 
which one often has to do after a fresh install.

Tried Brother email support. For Linux is only to point you to the tools
and then its your baby and the number of people that they have for Linux
support is very small so its also very very slow to get what help does
exist. I found the support basically non-existent even though they would
differ. The also have no telephone or chat support for *nix its only email
support and for complex problems that's a really awkward way of doing
things!

Also don't really have a formal network set up at present. I have been
recommended to use set up a ftp server and clients but my main box is also
out for R n R as I seem to have let out some magic smoke from one of the
hard drives.

This means that any changes are when I get my system back but will try
then. This information looks very very useful and I thank you very much for
your assistance!

Dee: you didn't answer this question.  It is important: all the layers
have to work, starting from the bottom, networking.

The specifications don't even mention networking but the W at the end
of the name indicates 802.11b/g/n support.

If this is so difficult, we ought to try one step at a time, and
networking is clearly the first step.

OK.  In other words, we should wait until then before bombarding you
with suggestions.

I would expect that you have a LAN and have other computer(s) still
functioning.  Perhaps not in Linux.

This KVM is an IOGEAR GCS1784.

<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817399043CVF>

Some of the reviewers on the newegg site mention keyboard and mouse
problems.  The KVM emulates the keyboard and mouse for each of the
computers so switching will be seamless.  This means that the real
mouse and keyboard have to be pretty generic or bad things happen.

I could not get any of my wireless-keyboard-and-mouse sets to work.
In each case, the mouse could not move down but only up.  Sometimes at
a disproportionate rate.  I could not get a wired keyboard and
wireless mouse to work.  So now I have a wired keyboard and mouse.

Apparently I could have gotten them to work (without the benefit of
emulation) by plugging them into the auxiliary USB connector of the
KVM.  It is switched, but each computer sees the device as being
plugged and unplugged whenever the switch switches away or towards the
computer.

Here are the weasel words that IOGEAR uses to explain this problem:

Dear All,

I just had occasion to open in Libre Office under Ubuntu 15.04 some 
(externally created) Europass CVs (with extension .doc), and LibreOffice 
made a real mess of them, overlaying lines over one another, etc.  Can 
anybody suggest a remedy?  The obsolete Word on my MacOS 10.4 system 
reads them perfectly...

With many thanks in advance,

On the mac, write them out as .rtf files.  That's Microsoft's 
version-independant-mostly format for copying between different 
versions. Those should be openable on a newer Libre Office.

Well, yes - on the Mac I can write an RTF or a  PDF.  I can also send 
the file to Zamzar for conversion.  But what I am (perhaps foolishly) 
dreaming of is some kind of Linux self-sufficiency.  I bought this 
machine in the hope of freeing myself from Apple and its likes...

This is strange, as Europass document templates are created and
distributed as native ODF:
https://europass.cedefop.europa.eu/en/documents/curriculum-vitae/templates-instructions

The ODT and Word .doc templates look clean to me on LibreOffice, so I
wonder if the sender of your documents fiddled with the contents a bit.
MS Word can do that.

Europass is supposed to embed standard field definitions that map
directly to a standard XML schema. It's possible that this could be
recovered from your Word docs and the results reformatted. It's also
just as likely that the creator of these documents broke them irreparably.

cheers,
 Stewart

Though it did produce this spluttering piece of hilarity from an MS
booster:
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2008-macword/can-word-open-a-odt-file/0b76ee36-a236-4a45-ace4-b145a5b2026f?auth=1

Yes, OOXML is an ISO standard, but ODF is too, and earlier, and doesn't
have weird "even we don't know what this does" settings.

For this reason, I keep a Win8.1 VM around (cheapo but legit licences
can be had) and a $100 annual subscription to Office. Yeah, it's an MS
tax, but if I need to read Track Changes documents exactly as they're
supposed to be, it's worth it. Once a document has touched Word, I
consider it irrevocably 'down converted', to use an old SGML term.

cheers,
 Stewart

There's a lot on Groklaw about how MS rammed OOXML through ISO and
pretty much crippled the committee in the process.

I can get Office 365 for free through work, but haven't bothered.  They
don't seem to have a Linux version available, so I'd have to run it in a
VM or only on my notebook, when booted into Windows.

The nutcase in that link seems to be under the mistaken impression that
OOXML replaced ODT as a standard.  This is of course not at all how
standards work.  All it did was add another standard to pick from.

All making OOXML an ISO standard actually did was make the ISO standard
process no longer have any respect what so ever given clearly the process
is now a joke that cab be bought.

Subject: [GTALUG] Problems with Samba After Upgrade to 14.04
Message-ID: <55A7A9FC.70104@rogers.com>

Background

I was using 12.04 for a long time and never experienced these problems.

I have a separate partition on which I back up my photography files from 
my Windows machine. I have ownership of the partition and Others have 
Create and Delete access.

On the partition I have a folder "photography". Using a right click in 
Nautilus I shared the folder, allowed others to create and delete files, 
and allowed guests access. When I created the share I told Nautilus to 
apply these settings to files in the folder.

Problem 1) I can access the shared photography directory and copy files 
to it. I cannot navigate to a nested folder. I get access denied. This 
is new with 14.04. How can I share the entire tree?

Problem 2) When I copy files from Windows to Ubuntu, they are created 
with an owner of "Nobody". WTF??? Worse, when I delete, as root, the 
files are no longer visible, but they still take up space!

/var/lib/samba/usershares/photography has:

#VERSION 2
path=/big0/photography
comment=
usershare_acl=S-1-1-0:F
guest_ok=y
sharename=photography

Any and all help appreciated!

Message-ID: <CAPpdf59Tcc4E4Hiig-1LKfbgNdTp7yey8zFEe0AMwDQfLkvXgw@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings

I have a large system with a fair number of resources which has just come
home from the hospital (computer) when I had a disk drive fail abruptly.

1.The tech tells me that the hard drive can be accessed. How do I do a low
level transfer to another hard drive?
(This would mean that I would have empty sectors but there is some
information that I would like to get.)

2. The drive was my 'operating system' drive. That meant that here is where
I kept my 14 VirtualBox machines. (One was my business record keeping
(accounting) and that is the one that I want real bad but its only 16
months of data so it can be redone but its painful!)

How do I set up the hard drive so that files can be moved to my RAID array
(which should be just fine) - - - or should I?
Should I be setting up this drive as it was before but just looking for a
way to do backups?
As I understand it operating systems on RAID isn't nice - - - or is it?

I am looking for something that doesn't crap out so completely. I
understand I should have had backups but I wasn't able to get the shared
folder stuff working so that I could seamlessly transfer stuff to my main
array. That would also be a viable option if someone can tell me how to
cudgel VirtualBox into submission.

Questions welcomed.

TIA

ddrescue can be handy for taking an image of a slightly defective
disk to somewhere else, so that you can then experiment on the copy to
recover things.

I think everything should be on RAID (and RAID0 doesn't count of course).
OS, swap, data, everything.  Disk failures happen, and they are a waste
of time to have to deal with.  RAID is of course NOT backup and not a
sustitute (since RAID does nothing to protect against data corruption
and user errors).

'dd' is the usual answer.  But, on a failing disk, it may really kill
it.  I've been told that freezing your disk helps with recovery.

Well, I don't recommend changing your setup, when you're doing recovery.
Do the recovery first.

Afterwards, you can use RAID for OS.  I think, most distro still ask for
separate boot partition, eg. /boot as ext4 for MBR setup, and of course
/boot/efi as fat32 for UEFI setup.  And, do backup.

DON'T make any sudden moves.  They are likely to be wrong since you
are upset and you are doing something new.

Yes, I do this:

1) raw ddrescue from the whole failing disk to a whole new disk.  (Make
sure that the new disk is at least as large as the old one!)  By
copying the whole disk, you get the partition table and boot blocks.
But you also get the same UUIDs so it is best to not have the two
disks on the same machine after the copy is done (mount etc. will be
confused).

2) Then put the failing disk on a shelf

3) Then play with the new disk.

I find it best to do this from a live USB stick or CD so I'm not
acutally booting off the bad hard drive, the new hard drive, or even
just the same controller.

Make sure that the live system does not use the sick disk's swap
partition.

Note: ddrescue is a bit tricky, but it is brilliant.  Read the manual
twice before using it.  Google for examples of usage.  I've posted to
this list messages about how to use it.  You DO want to let it use a
logfile!

Somewhere in there I do a
	smartctl -x /dev/sda
and capture the output somewhere on another machine.  I want to ask
the drive what it thinks is going on.

BTW, keep in mind that the identification of the problem is
provisional.  Subsequent observations may point the finger elsewhere.
Eg. power supply, disk controller, RAM, sunspots.

I've actually done that: ran the power into the freezer and the data
cable out and got the data I needed: the drive had been pretty much
deceased before it went in there.  It was surprisingly effective.  I
suppose it depends on the malady: I'd say it's worth a try.

Subject: [GTALUG] [OT] How does Google amass this information?
Message-ID: <87a8ut93ws.fsf@darkstar-0.algarveservers.com>

I recently set up a new domain, AlgarveServers.com - after using
AzurServers.com for three years after moving from France to
Portugal, I thought it was about time although I still maintain my
dial-up account with Free.fr, but dropped my ADSL account.

And at that time (2-3 months ago) I switched my http  server from
Xitami to nginx  (Apologies to, but not trolling the Apache crowd.)

I don't use a firewall since I was advised on irc that, being on a
LAN behind a router, a firewall was superfluous. ("The CIA and
Hackers simply love Firewalls" is the gist of what I was told)

I do run several websites but the traffic is not overly heavy
being bicycle racing oriented in the main. eg:
<http://www.algarveservers.com/sportsite>
However, the Sortsite is also available on two other servers so
traffic is presumably shared amongst the three.

And for outbound email I use "sendgrid.net" which is in reality
designed to send gargantuan quantities of emails from any address
to any address. It is in effect a spam-site although you don't
necessarily have to send spam and sendgrid net pledges never to
reveal your real address..

i don't send any spam and my free account is limited to 4800
emails per month.

I use a Slackware or Tails operating system. Mostly Slackware; Tor
mostly for a browser and Emacs/GNUS for a mailer some local stuff,
mainly cronjob output, uses "mail/nail/mailx"

So how can Google develop so much information as is revealed by
typing "AlgarveServers.com" into the TOR search field? EG: the
following information. or is this a Dumsky question?

According to my thinking, http://zc280035100/algarveservers.com
should get "Not Found", but no, there's some more details there.

Can anyone tell me how to watch real time streaming of the PanAm games
from cbc.ca/panam?    When I click on a streaming link on that page
all I get is a black rectangle.  I must be missing something.  I have
Debian Jessie and Iceweasel.

After receiving a tip off list I installed Google Chrome and so was
able to see and hear the clips on cbc.ca/panam.  The question of why I
could not use Iceweasel for that purpose however remains.

Hi Ken,

In the address bar (also location bar or URL bar) when I type:
*about:addons *or *about:plugins*

I can see the version of flash being used by Iceweasel and in my case it
is: *Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202. *

And in Chrome when I type:
*chrome://plugins/*

it shows me Adobe Flash Player* - Version: 16.0.0.305*
* Shockwave Flash 16.0 r0*

So am guessing Ice-weasel is unable to play the stream due to the flash
version not being the very latest as in chrome.

Thank's - Aruna

That is one of the problems one runs in to with watching live video off of 
websites run by TV networks. Their sites are set up to be used by Windows 
users, almost as if everyone uses Windows (or has access to a machine that 
runs Windows). They often use, or require the latest version of some Windows 
created player software. The Linux versions often lag behind and you find 
you can't see their video.

I had that happen on a site showing Olympics coverage where I needed to use 
Moonlight(?) which was the Linux equivalent of the Windows specific plug-in 
needed to play the website video. The latest version of Moonlight wasn't 
able to play the video as you required the almost very latest version of 
Silverlight (IIRC).

The same thought also occurred to me.  My Iceweasel has flashplayer
11.2.202.401; whereas the chrome version I downloaded has 18.0.0.209.
 Adobe is no longer providing upgrades to flashplayer for linux --
only security fixes to version 11.2.202.

What we need now is an open source equivalent of the latest
flashplayer along with something like the default user agent, which
fools websites into believing the user has MSIE, to fool sites into
believing that the user has the latest version of Adobe flashplayer.
In the absence of an open source equivalent to flashplayer the
usefulness of Iceweasel, and probably Firefox as well, is compromised.

I had the same problem during the Winter Olympics in Vancouver and
Whistler.  I never did get Silverlight to work effectively, as much I
think caused by a slow internet connection as anything else.  At the
time I was in Thailand.

No, what we need is to educate the mass media outlets et. al. that
free software exists that does not require them to spend $$$ on
licenses for proprietary software that has been limiting their
advertising reach to yet more eyeballs.

Do you mean that there is an open source equivalent to flashplayer
which the CBC could have used?

Subject: [GTALUG] Thinkpad T420 as a VM host
Message-ID: <55AC1E4A.3050508@gmail.com>

So I replaced a 4GB memory stick in my Thinkpad  T420 with an 8GB one
bringing the total amount of available ram to 12GB with maximum of
16GB.Even though Lenovo say that the laptop supports only 8 GB of ram total.

As it stands now this 4 year old machine becomes a pretty cost-effective
platform for virtualization:

* Intel Core i5-2410M
* 16GB max memory (~$65 per 8GB stick).
* 2 SATA ports (built-in and ultrabay)
* 2 mSata ports (one could be used for solid state storage)
* 1 eSata port.
* 1 Gigabit ethernet
* 1 SD card

Canada computers sells refurbished ones for about $300 and I think there
are some available in Brampton. Also I saw a few similar refurbished
machines on Amazon.

Alex.

So, are you going to post your experience of VMs on it?
Or, are you selling it? ;-)

I just added some RAM for relatively cheap and it got me thinking that
this little laptop satisfies pretty much all the requirements for a VM
machine even though it's a laptop and is old.

They could use HTML5 video <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video>. 
I did a fresh install of Fedora 21 recently and didn't bother to install 
the Flash player so I have no Flash support in Firefox. I can watch 
YouTube videos perfectly well. Vimeo is also fine. Facebook video isn't 
and many web sites still cling to Flash. For those, the embedded Flash 
player in Chrome works fine.

1) HTML5 video

2) The streams don't work with Gnash either (a free software Flash player/plugin)
