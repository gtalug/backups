All newspaper websites have to compete for clicks, especially when faced
with the brutal onslaught that is the Daily Mail. The Guardian is run by
an independent foundation, and is able to carry stories (like the whole
Wikileaks/Snowden thing) that others won't touch. It's also (formerly)
famous for its lack of proof-reading, hence its nickname, The Grauniad.

The Globe and Mail used to share more stories with the Guardian, but
ever since the Globe lurched more to the right, these have tapered off
to nothing.

A new Raspberry Pi 2 is set for release with a new Broadcom BCM2836 quad
core Cortex A7:

My understanding is this new RPi moves to ARMv7 and I will be able to run
the vanilla ARM release of Debian Jessie?
