If you can, deliver it to FreeGeek. They'll re-use or refurbish it,
and if it's completely unusable they'll take it apart and get a few
semoleans from their upstream recycler.

Better them than a for-profit recycler.

Yes, that is the best answer.

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,

those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID
