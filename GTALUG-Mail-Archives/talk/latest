Thanks!  You present several good choices.

I see that this time we are only allowed to vote for one.
Last time we were allowed to tick more than one.

I'd prefer to see a way of providing more information.  I'm not sure
what it would look like.  Ranking?  Fractional votes?


More details of the choices:

Restaurant Formerly Known As Love at First Bite (Pizza)
	We know this one.  Not bad at all.

Kaiju (Japanese Curry)
	- we went there once before.  Service a bit overwhelmed
	  but very polite and accomodating.

	- one of several restaurants in the food court.
	  + allows alternate choices while eating together
	  + but most are closed at our time

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka
	Japanese noodle soup chain.
	<http://www.santouka.co.jp/en/menu/index.html>	
	<http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-toronto-2>

Lou Dawg's (BBQ)
	We've been there once (some of us more, I think).
	<http://loudawgs.com/home.html>

The Senator (Diner)
	<http://thesenator.com/>
	Apparently the New York Times reviewed it!
	By the prices, I'd call this a faux diner.
	The cheapest entree (today?) is
	"8 oz Cumbraeâ€™s Naturally Raised Beef Burger - $16"
	(Cumbrae is a very well thought of local butcher)

OPA! of Greece Dundas Street (Greek)
	<http://www.opasouvlaki.ca/home>
	A national chain / franchise.  May well be good.

Banh Mi Boys (Vietnamese)
	<http://www.banhmiboys.com/menu.htm>

	I remember discovering Banh Mi on Spadina, near Dundas.
	Amazing sandwiches for $1 or $1.25.  Well they've gone up
	there to perhaps $2 (I haven't looked since TLUG and Hacklab
	deserted the area.

	These guys do an upmarket version.  Surely worth the money.
	But it makes me wistful for the good old days ("more
	authentic").

Hi Alex,

If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

I currently have T43, and its keyboard is difficult to type on, at least
for me.
    - it's stiff, so you need to "push" rather than "tap", 
    - it doesn't spring back, fast enough or "crispy" enough, so you
      actually notice and become aware of the keypresses.  And, that
      interferes with my typing.

Are you able to type fast and comfortably on your T420?

A long time ago (more than a decade) someone used XEmacs as the basis
of a window manager:

It's been pretty much abandoned for the last seven years.

This is more of a test of the LimeSurvey web application.

There is a way to do ranking questions[1] in LimeSurvey so we can try
that next month.

The nearest to "in practice" that has arrived is the series of tiling
window managers
that have UIs loosely similar to GNU Screen.

I'm thinking of ratpoison, stumpwm, dwm, and such.  The model they take
is that windows correspond (more or less) to Emacs buffers, and one's
attachment of a set of buffers to the display (e.g. - which buffers you've
got visible) correspond to a "workspace" concept.

You set up key bindings to let you adjust window ("buffer") visibility on
screen,
and key bindings to let you switch workspaces (which would lead to
displaying
a different set of buffers/windows).

I'm usually using stumpwm these days, almost always with just one workspace,
so that I see one window at a time, switching when I want to head to another
window ("buffer").

That seems to be where control of this has gone.  There may have been some
code around to enable having Emacs talk directly to stumpwm, not obvious
where it is (and I notice that the repo has moved from Savannah to GitHub,
which probably means I need to "rebase" my use of it; I've apparently been
tracking a dead-ish branch).  Direct Emacs integration has gotten pretty
secondary, it seems.

I think I'd be way more inclined to use stumpwm, and have some Emacs
hooks to talk to it (which isn't hard to have) than to talk directly to X
from
Emacs.

I have a new  T440p with 16GB, running Fedora 22, thus far it's reasonable.
I'm a hunt-and-peck person, so the KB isn't a big consideration: it 
works, I'm happy.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs.  Fewer cores and
  lower clock rates, for a start.  There are exceptions but they are
  outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs.  But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
  do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained.  May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
  (but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
  fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware.  Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take 
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts 
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful 
and expandable (may depend on the generation).  My son's W520 will accept 
up to 32G of RAM, I think.  Lennart has a similar one.  And it comes with 
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue).  It is fine, but not
a revelation.  I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches.  I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Considering amount of typing I do, keyboard is very important for me.  I
use Topre Realforce keyboard (capacitive key).  It's the most expensive
keyboard, but my wrists would not have lasted this long without it.

I can accept the hassle of external keyboard with laptop... if the
laptop has 16GB.  On my Slackware machine, my ram usage is 8GB (out of
16GB total).  Firefox-31.8.0esr alone is using 4GB!  That leaves 8GB for
VMs.

I have a rather depressing variety of mechanical keyboards, including
a couple IBM Model Ms.  To clarify my biases, I LOVE the feel of the
IBM Model M keys.  My keyboard at work is a Kinesis Advantage with
their standard Cherry Brown switches.  I think the Advantage's
physical layout is about the best that's available in any keyboard
right now: vertical columns (rather than slanted columns we still
persist in copying from typewriters: not only is it no longer
necessary, it's actually ergonomically bad), dished hand areas to
match differences in finger length, and a split between the hands.

I have three Kinesis Advantages.  As mentioned, one has the original
Cherry Browns.  They're okay.  I have a second that I refitted with
Cherry Blues: that's the one I use at home.  That's my idea of a great
keyboard.  The Cherry Blues are about as close as you'll get to the
behaviour of the IBM Model M buckling spring keys (short of buying one
of the Unicomp keyboards that actually have buckling springs).  They
have a strong tactile click when the key activates.  It's also
audible: it's just as well I live alone, as the Blues are notoriously
loud and irritate the crap out of people nearby (just like the Model
M).  I refitted the third Kinesis Advantage with Cherry Clears.
Initially they feel quite similar to the Browns, but they're stiffer:
you don't notice it immediately, but after a couple hours of typing, I
found it genuinely tiring to use.  I don't use it much.

I highly recommend the Cherry Blues to non-gamers.  Just be prepared
for the noise.  The bigger Canada Computers stores usually have
several keyboards with different Cherry switches out for testing.

If anyone has questions about any of this, feel free to contact me
off-list: I've been a bit of a keyboard wonk for a couple decades.

I brought it to work to replace the crap PC standard one that came with the
office PC. Quieter then Cherry Blue but still noisier than the squishy
standard, works just as good for me.

Based on the statuses (e.g. - autoRenewPeriod), nope, they didn't.
The registry did that automatically.  (There's standard policy about that.
See RFC 3915)

I wouldn't assume that all will necessarily "be well"; the DNS info is
pretty
clear about pointing it to a "parking zone".

The bit of being in autoRenewPeriod means things are a bit on "autopilot,"
and I'd kind of expect that the registrar is trying to pester the owner to
pay them.

If the folk managing the domain have forgotten about it, and email
addresses
have changed, and such, then perhaps the warnings of Deletion Coming
Soon will disappear into the aether.

If anyone knows anyone involved (e.g. - perhaps the Shawn Amundson
indicated in contact information in WHOIS), it's probably worth giving them
a poke soon-ish otherwise the domain may go away.  An email address
of form "something at gimp.org" won't work, for sure, right now.

| From: William Park <opengeometry at yahoo.ca>

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now. But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs. Fewer cores and
lower clock rates, for a start. There are exceptions but they are
outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs. But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained. May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
(but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware. Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful
and expandable (may depend on the generation). My son's W520 will accept
up to 32G of RAM, I think. Lennart has a similar one. And it comes with
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

- quad core i7-4710hq
- 1920x1080 17" IPS screen
- 16G of RAM (that may well be the limit)
- NVIDIAÂ® GeForceÂ® GTX860M Graphics with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older
ThinkPads. One of the main complaints about newer ThinkPad keyboards is
"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- keyboards are at least partially a matter of personal taste

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,

Many typists like being sure when they press a key.

Significant key travel is considered desirable by many (but not all).

A tactile signal of a keypress registering is considered a Good Thing
(except by many gamers). Something sort of lost with most modern
key structures.

There has been a renaissance of mechanical keyboards. They cost

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue). It is fine, but not
a revelation. I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches. I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Ouch.  This is an argument in favour of having different parts of services
in some different places, particularly email services.

Interesting tool I saw pointed at in the discussion; it offers the ability
to notify SEVERAL people of impending expiries of domains and SSL certs.
    http://www.expirify.com/about/
It of course has some clear "and why should I trust this with anything
important?" issues.

Hi William,

I used to have T42 a few years ago, and after years of abuse the
keyboard on that laptop starter to bend and rattle as I typed, that kind
of annoyed me but that was caused due to wear and tear, although your
keyboard has a different defect, I suspect it was caused by the same
reason. At this point your T43 is 10 years old.

Other than that I would consider thinkpad keyboars as good of a laptop
keyboard as it could ever be -- both for layout (function pgup/down keys
in a separate row) and key travel (it is pretty crisp).

Unlike other laptop keyboards, especially cramped netbook keyboards, I'm
able to type comfortably for extended periods of time without getting
any pain in my wrists, keys are big, far apart and I have sausage
fingers. Still it is not as good as separate keyboard, and a good
computer table/chair combo, as laptops by their design, inherently put
you in a suboptimal typing position, but it is as good as it possibly
gets for a laptop.

I tend to be pretty hard on keyboard so on average I tend to replace the
keyboard on my laptop every few years -- there are three variants. So
far I've used two types -- the only difference I've noticed is in the
design of butterfly mechanism supporting the keys. I've been been
completely contend with both.

https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-76711

Replacing a keyboard on a thinkpad is a really easy thing to do,
instructions for replacing most of the things on thinkpads are available
on lenovo website.

https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-76809


If you're planning to use a T420 as a desktop, I highly suggest you
getting a docking station, you can get one really cheap these days, and
it might support dual external screens.

I just bought a T440p as a dev machine, and am running vagrant -> 
VirtualBox -> CentOS 6 to run in turn a full stack of PostgerSQL,  Java 
on Tomcat, Java and Scala on Play! and angular on the browser.

I barely notice it, and probably will have a couple of inactive VMs set 
up, so I can switch back and forth between unrelated tasks. Build 
performance is good, in part because I'm rarely compiling linking and 
provisioning more than one thing at any given moment! 
Eclipse/Maven/java/Scala are memory hogs, though, so I bought 16 GB of ram.

A much smaller netbook gave good build performance, but was constrained 
to 4 GB, and I needed at least 8 and perhaps 12, so bought a machine 
with slots (;-))

  Hi Abby,

  Googling  UEFI BIOS disable  should bring up quite a few links.  
Unfortunately, there is no standardized way of disabling the UEFI and
switching back to using BIOS.  In general, there are basically two challenges:

  1) getting the attention of the firmware that runs on initial startup
before the operating system (Windows or Linux) gets to start,  and

  2) navigating the setup menus to disable the UEFI.


  Doing the first usually requires you to press or hold down a particular
key at a particular time, which one and when depends upon the manufacturer.
Depending upon a number of factors, you may or may not see a splash screen 
providing a hint while booting.  Knowing the make and model of your computer
can also help to determine this.  Most computer manufacturers should
have user documentation in PDF format that you can download from their
web site.

  I hope that this helps.

Once you find the UEFI settings in the BIOS you may find that access to it 
is disabled. You will most likely need to set a supervisor password for the 
BIOS before it will let you have access to the UEFI settings. Just remember 
to remove the supervisor password when you are done (if you don't want/need it).

Once you find the UEFI settings in the BIOS you may find that access to it 
is disabled. You will most likely need to set a supervisor password for the 
BIOS before it will let you have access to the UEFI settings. Just remember 
to remove the supervisor password when you are done (if you don't want/need it).

Subject: [GTALUG] Ubuntu update gone bad
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1508091030010.25880@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I'm writing this at the point of annoyance.  Maybe I'll find a fix in a 
minute or two.

I took an Acer Revo out of service as an HTPC.  It was dual boot Win 7 and 
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I applied all Win 7 updates.  Fine.  Stupid, but fine.

I applied all Ubuntu 12.04 updates.  Fine.  Not even stupid.

It offered me Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  I said to go ahead.  I almost never do 
version upgrades, out of fear, but I didn't have much to lose.  And 
everyone always says Ubuntu version upgrades are smooth as silk.

Negative observation one: version upgrades take more real time than 
re-installations.  (But they should take less of my attention and care, a 
win.)

Negative observation two: I thought that the slow upgrade process could 
happen while I was asleep.  Yes, but not in one night: there were three 
steps in the middle that required me to answer a question.  It would have 
been better if the questions had been moved to the beginning or the end.  
Fedora does that.

Negative observation three:  It all appeared to work.  The updater 
disappeared from the screen (a little odd).  top(1) showed no remnant.  
So I rebooted.  Now I have the prompt:
	grub rescue>
which means I have nothing, not even Win7.  I don't think that I can type 
anything useful into that prompt.

Obviously the third is the lulu.

The fact that I am using LTS should indicate my risk aversion.

I will fix this but I will remember.

Revos have an EFI bios, right? I used to get this all the time on my
Samsung Chronos, until I blew away the dual-boot and put it back into
legacy (aka "working") BIOS mode.

Boot-Repair <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair> on a
bootable USB stick will likely fix it. Under certain circumstances,
Windows updates will routinely destroy grub, so keep this stick handy.

Message-ID: <20150809195953.7269fdc4ceced4fa6fe554fa@eol.ca>

   I have just installed Fedora_22 on my Lenovo Thinkpad T400 laptop.
I cannot get the networking to work, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.  

   I can turn Wi-Fi on, and I can see the Wi-Fi servers.  When I
connect to mine, it just sits there trying to connect until it times
out.  I tried connecting with an invalid Wi-Fi password, and it
prompted me for the correct one, so it is validating this, but not
connecting.   

   When I look at dmesg, I see a bunch of messages about authenticating
and deauthinticating to a MAC address.  This MAC address matches the
address of my router except for the last number, which is 87, and
should be 86.  Fedora_22 no longer has /var/log/messages. 

   I had some difficulties when I did the install from DVD.  A screen
came up and said "Oh no!  Something has occurred and the system can't
recover. All extensions have been disabled as a precaution."  I
searched the web and I removed xorg-x11-drv-libinput.  This got the
install working.  I removed it from the actual installed computer, as
per the instructions on the website.  I was having network problems
both before and after I did this. 

   Has anybody seen anything like this?  Fedora_20 was a fairly easy
install for ordinary mortals.  Fedora_22 seems to be a huge step
backwards.

   Thanks.

No need for this drastic action.  I've dual booted Ubuntu with Windows 
using EFI without a problem.

Yes, boot repair is an excellent tool.  The other route is to boot off 
of a Ubuntu live cd, click on try Ubuntu and mount your drives to /mnt.  
Chroot to /mnt and try to to reinstall grub.  Look for errors and 
correct them.

I've seen this with Linux Mint Debian Edition (the first release from
March 2014); I bypassed the problem by assigning a static IP address
to the laptop (Asus netbook) for that particular location.

I believe the access point is at fault in my case, since the Asus
netbook has no trouble connecting to APs at other locations.

Message-ID: <CAOO1MfutDkpa6RM2SuK97uUhbP93gyO5zMGXM-wjqct9eE0jGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
I am writing a bourne shell script, to read a binary file as input and take
action depending on the contents of the file.

The file is a mixture of ASCII and binary codes (such as ASCII filed
lengths and flags).

I have the processing already done in C. I would like to convert it to a
bourne shell.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what combination of tools I may be able
to use?

You don't need "tools" to write Bourne shell script, because the script
itself is text file.  If you're talking about shell wrapper, then
    #! /bin/sh
    your_c_program "$@"
would call your C program with the same arguments.  You can use "exec"
to replace the script, if you want PID to be the same, ie.
    #! /bin/sh
    exec your_c_program "$@"

If you're only trying to look at the ASCII data (and trying to process
binary data in Bash seems like a poor idea), then you may want to look
at the "strings" command:

$ strings $(which ls)

"strings" is part of the binutils package on Debian.

If you have the program in C to process data, going to bash is like
swapping a large truck for a turtle. Bash will be orders of magnitude
slower, and you will have to take a lot of care to pipe data all over awk,
sed, tr and the like.
Bash is a terrible choice, python (or perl, or PHP) would be faster. Way
faster.

You jumped over 3 other releases in between. One of which would have been 
another LTS release. I have done upgrades in Ubuntu when I used to run it 
and I usually had no problem. In my case I would do a series of upgrades 
when I only two or three releases behind the current one. If I am too far 
behind then I would go the route of a fresh install.

You are jumping up by four releases and you can find some programs were 
replaced by other programs which can complicate the upgrade process in some 
situations.

Yes, they often can.

I prefer to do the updates during the day so I can keep an eye on it. There 
are extra questions that can be asked of you during an install that would 
bring the process to a halt until an answer is provided.

This could be one of a few issues. It could be a failed update to the grub 
bootloader, it could be the Windows update changed the boot partitions or 
removed the grub bootloader, or possibly a UEFI related boot issue.

If (or, rather when) Windows update messed with the bootloader it usually 
makes it so the system boots straight to Windows. Seeing a grub prompt means 
that is not the case here.

You can go in to the BIOS of your computer and disabled UEFI boot. I ran in 
to an issue with it on one of my systems. If that isn't the case you may be 
able to issue some commands at the grub prompt to get the system to boot.

I don't know if things are the same with grub 2 but in grub 1 you would use 
four commands. "root", "linux", "initrd", and finally "boot" to get the 
system up.

For example:
root (hd0,1)
linux /boot/vmlinuz-<insert-kernel-version-here>
initrd /boot/initrd.img-<insert-kernel-version-here>
boot

The root line would point to the drive and partition containing the linux 
kernel and initrd files (what you know often know as /boot when the system 
is running).

The linux and initrd lines can take command line completion so you can hit 
the tab key to see which kernel and/or initrd files are available. The last 
word "boot" takes no arguments. It uses the information from the first three 
commands and attempts to boot your system.

Subject: [GTALUG] Ubuntu with all-desktops-in-one ?
Message-ID: <20150810200226.GA5950@node1.localdomain>

Hi all,

With Debian, you can install all desktops (kde, gnome, xfce, etc) from
ISO at first, and then choose which the desktop when you log in via
gdm/kdm.

Is there a version for Ubuntu which allows you to do that?
Right now, you have to choose/install different ISO for each desktop.

Or, do I have to start with "minimal install", and then install all
the desktops afterwards?  But, I don't know if gdm/kdm will pick up
the desktops.

I will stick to my keytronic (currently an E03600U2).  I hate the noise
of the old IBMs.  Fortunately the model M is durable enough to
sufficiently punish anyone who tries to use one nearby that the keyboard
won't suffer any damage and can still be used by someone else that
politely does so when they are alone. :)

That is NOT what you want to do.  You want to disable 'secureboot' not
disable 'UEFI'.  Not the same thing.  Nothing wrong with UEFI at all,
just secureboot.

What you want is to enter the setup and find the setting that turns off
secureboot, and that is it.  Booting in UEFI mode is perfectly fine and
most linux distributions have no issue with UEFI (and grub2 works fine
with it too).  UEFI also means you get to use GPT for your partition
setup, which is much nicer than the old primary/extended/logical partition
crap we used to deal with.

If you really want, you can look for CSM (Compatibility Support Module)
boot mode and use that, which should boot with BIOS compatibility services
allowing you to install older OSs that require a BIOS.

Well for Windows 8 certification Microsoft required that there must be
a user controllable setting to turn it off (although it must be on by
default).  I am under the impression that Windows 10 certification no
longer requires that such an option exist, so unfortunately some system
makers might stupidly decide to not have such an option (of course no
sane person should then buy from them, but many people won't know that).

Hi William,

This doesn't answer your original question, but I'd install minimal
system and then install all the desktop environments, because minimal
system is a lot easier to troubleshoot than installer environment.

You then can install all the desktop environments you want with tasksel
tool -- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tasksel

KDM/GDM are smart enough to detect all desktop environment, though you'd
be better off installing only one of these.

https://www.google.com/search?q=kdm+select+desktop+environment&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI76vC4ayfxwIVAxs-Ch05KQA1&biw=1600&bih=728

In debian these days, you can install one of the desktops by just
installing one of the task-desktop packages, I don't know if this method
trickled down to ubuntu yet.

That's nothing compared to the dire and baroque things the coworker who
used to sit across from me was going to do if anyone brought in a Model
M.  Of course, you have to be faster than the proprietor of said keyboard
if you want to do any of that.

At least the Lenovo keyboards work uses consistently hit the minimum
standard for a usable keyboard.  But it seems a shame not to be able to
do my best coding there.  There's really nothing as nice to type on as
a quarter-century-old Model M.

And hey, if I wanted to make noise why bother with a Model M when I can
fire up my chainsaw?  :-)

I also like the M keyboard.  I picked up a few several years ago.  The
only issue was I had to get a PS/2 - USB adapter to use the keyboard
with my KVM.

Here is the complete background.

I need to write a tool to run on Linux that will do an LDAP lookup on
Active Directory for a specific 'hidden' attribute that tells the client
which Active Directory site it belongs to. The tool is part of a larger
suite (keytab creation, krb5.conf config etc) already written in Bourne.
Unfortunately, the value that is returned from AD is a binary blob. So
while I can call ldapsearch to retrieve the value, I still need something
to process/decompress the attribute.

The algorithm to decompress the blob is the same as is outlined in RFC
1035. But Windows implementations of such are sparsely documented.

I needed to ensure that I understood the decompression algorithm so I wrote
some fairly portable code to do both the LDAP lookup and  perform the
decompression of the binary blob.

So while I can port the code from Windows to Linux fairly easily, I would
like the tool to be converted to Bourne so that it can be a single script
(rather than having to deploy a script and an executable).

The Restaurant Formerly Know As Love At First Bite won the vote with
31.25% of the vote.

The next vote will be done by ranking ballet instead of the one choice.

I am going off this list <http://wiki.gtalug.org/pre-meeting_dinner>
and you are welcome to add more restuarants.

Unfortunately each generation has different keyboards so they are
not comparable.  The x30 models went to chicklet keyboards (which I so
far am very happy with), but the x40 (no idea if the x40p is the same)
has had a lot of complaints about keyboard latyout and most of all the
changes to the trackpad and trackpoint buttons, although the some updates
have fixed that again (like the W541).

I think the x20 was the last with the classic thinkpad keyboard, but I
am not entirely sure since I never used one myself.

The W530 is perfectly portable.  It closes and fits in a large bag and
can be carried places. :)

I would hate to do it on a regular basis though.

It does support 32GB ram and in my case has a Core-i7 CPU, which means
quad core + hyperthreading at about 3GHz.  The fact it has a 170W power
supply probably tells something about the power consumption.

Actually I suspect it is french canadian keyboard.  One of the worst
keyboard layouts ever made.  Looking at some pictures, that is in fact
the case.

Of course things can be fixed:
http://us.estore.asus.com/collections/replacement-keyboard/products/g751jm-1a-k-b_us_module-as-90nb06g1-r30300

I did that with my wife's ideapad a few years ago (partially because
the keyboard broke and it was easier to get a US replacement which was
also desirable).

I suspect the newer chicklet style thinkpad keyboard might actually be
an improvement then.

I suspect I would be the opposite.  I like the W530 keyboard (which is
the same as the T530).

Too noisy and a bit too hard to press for my liking.  Old IBm keyboards
never die, but I sure don't miss them.

You might get noticed carrying one of those.

Well from what I can find the process is:

When you see Toshiba logo, hit F2, then you should be in the UEFI (BIOS)
settings.

Under security tab there should be an option for 'secure boot' which
you want to set to disabled.  If you want to keep windows working,
that should be all you change, and then you should be able to install
linux as long as the distribution is new enough to support UEFI booting.
If you don't want to keep windows and you want to use an older style
distribution that does not do UEFI booting, then you have to also find
the "CSM boot" setting (under advanced/system settings) and turn that on.
That will break booting windows 8.1 on the machine though.  I would
personally stick with UEFI booting these days.

I had this same problem on an Acer laptop until I discovered you need to
enter a password and enable the password.

When you are finished disabling things, you can then disable the password.

I mentioned the other day to someone on this list that you may have to set a 
supervisor password in the BIOS before you can change the UEFI and/or

removed the supervisor password if you don't really want it long term.

Something has come up and William will not be able to give his talk
tonight on Samba. We will be rescheduling him for the September
meeting.

Tonight's meeting will be a Round Table Q&A Session where we will take
questions from the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts
to answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way
to meet fellow members of our community and discover the skill sets we
each bring to the table.

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC6U1NhkEjVD8m3JL07vFOFqa=O7GmNNm0VKxEfrTPuLQw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing a Python script that checks git repositories in the user's
home folder (other folders is an option that should be added soon) and
then tells you their status, both local and remote.  I want to release
it publicly using github, but I'd like to maintain a private repo, and
only push certain releases to github.  I admit this is mostly because
I keep extensive notes in the source code and am perhaps a bit
embarrassed what those notes say both about my memory and my limited
coding skills.  I should probably just get over it - particularly
since the code itself probably says more than the notes.  But - git is
flexible enough that I imagine that this is an option: has anybody
done this?

As my knowledge of Python is somewhat rudimentary, so is my knowledge
of git.  The only thing I'm fairly sure about is that rebasing will be
involved.  If I wasn't concerned about pull requests (as novel as it
seems now, I like to hope they'll happen) this could be done in any
number of sloppy ways.  But it seems like I need either a branch or a
separate repo (which, and why?) that includes only the github data,
and I need my private repo to have the github one as a "tracked
branch" or something like that that I can merge from.  Is this making
sense, or am I thinking about it all wrong?

I welcome all suggestions and thoughts, thanks.

If you don't want to share the commit messages you can change the easily
with `git commit --amend` (see this
<https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/>).

If you are afraid of things you have committed you can use `git rebase
-i HEAD~10` which will allow you to squash the last 10 commits and allow
you to rewrite the commit message.

I would clone a new repo to test how it's going to work. You don't want
an detached head :-).

Have you seen this: <https://github.com/mixu/gr> it's basically what you
are doing written in Node.js.

I don't think this is so much a Python matter as a question of how you deal
with your work in your branches.  (And maybe I'm wrong, but I'll run
through the "squash" answer quickly!)

The thing that I'll often do that is like this is to open local branches to
fix bugs, and then, when preparing for release, to merge the results into
the branch I want to push publicly, using the --squash option to get rid of
any cruddy little commits that might seem embarrassing.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5308816/how-to-use-git-merge-squash

The first example seems pretty good...

Suppose I did my work (with a bunch of dumb little commits) on the "bugfix"
branch, and I want to put it into the "master" branch, voila...

git checkout master
git merge --squash bugfix
git commit
git push some-public-remote master

This addresses the problem of "cleaning up messy commits."

If the problem is that you want some of your python sources to get
released, and others not, then you'd presumably need to have some sort of
tool that rewrites the Python to remove (most? all?) comments.  Writing a
"let me bowlderize the python code" tool seems likely to get real messy...

A co-worker has suggested I create a new repo and simply copy the
files I want to put on github into it.  Since there will only be three
or four files, this seems reasonable.  Likewise, future commits could
be copied over with less comments in the code and a public-friendly
commit message.  And (possibly most important), the private repo could
have a branch with the github repo (and its pull requests) as a
remote.  This is so far seeming like the simplest solution.

Well you might have to type an admin password to unlock some settings.

But windows 8 logo certification requires that the end user be able to
change that setting, so there has to be a way.  Otherwise it would not
be allowed to ship with a windows 8 logo sticker on it.

Some places say that if a supervisor password is set it has to be cleared
before you can change secure boot.

And you have to be sure windows 8 is really shutdown before entering
the bios, which supposedly you do by holding shift down when telling
windows to shutdown/restart.

So you have to set a supervisor/admin password for the bios before you

Well thinkpads have a bios setting to swap fn and control for those
that prefer it that way (and in the case of my wife's thinkpad when she
broke the fn key, being able to swap it with control meant a key for
controling the keyboard light and brightness existed again until we got
a replacement keyboard).

Dell has the keys wrong of course and no option to swap them.  Also their
keyboard sucks and the touchpad and trackpoint are awful.  Dell sucks. :)

My experience with open source is that it is undercommented, if indeed it
has any comments at all. (Darktable, I'm looking at you.) It's enormously
helpful to understand the writer's thinking process. People can skip over
the comments or even do a selective erase if they don't like them.

Then, if the reader understands your objective and finds your code clunky
in achieving that objective, they can show their superior grasp by
providing an alternative (often more concise and difficult to understand)
solution.

I'm reminded of stories of Gauss, the famous mathematician and scientist
of whom it was said 'he removed all the scaffolding from his
constructions, so it appeared he arrived at the result by magic'. There's
too much of that kind of thinking in software.

Subject: [GTALUG] Locking KDE 5 screen from shell script
Message-ID: <55CAF405.5050805@rjonasz.org>

I recently installed kde5 on debian stretch.  I have a yubikey which I 
use to log in with.  I'd like to lock the screen when I remove the 
yubikey.  I have it working with cinnamon and lxde but I can't quite get 
it with kde.  I can lock the screen if I run the shell script from a 
terminal as root but when I remove the yubikey the shell script returns 
error code 1.

Here's my shell scripts:

ykgone.sh

Konsole output
#! /bin/sh
if [ -z "$(lsusb | grep Yubikey)" ] ; then
        if [ ! -z "$(ps aux | grep cinnamon-session | grep -v grep)" ] ; 
then
                /bin/su rjonasz -c "DISPLAY=:0 
cinnamon-screensaver-command -l"
        elif [ ! -z "$(ps aux | grep startkde | grep -v grep)" ] ; then
                /usr/bin/sudo -u rjonasz -H -i  /usr/local/bin/lockkde.sh
        else
                /bin/su rjonasz -c "DISPLAY=:0 xscreensaver-command --lock"
        fi
fi


lockkde.sh

Konsole output
#! /bin/sh

kde_pid=`pidof kdeinit5`
export `cat /proc/$kde_pid/environ|grep -ao 
'DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=[[:graph:]]*'`
/usr/bin/qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock


I can't seem to figure this one out.

Thanks for any help!

You could change this line
ps aux | grep cinnamon-session | grep -v grep

to this
pgrep cinnamon-session

It's cleaner and works well.

To answer the main question, try to install bashdb and run the script thru
it. It's the bash debugger, it's far more powerful than bash -vx.

Are you sure the PATH is set the same when run from a terminal versus
when run by your key being removed?

Try for debugging to do at the start of the script:

echo $PATH > /tmp/$$.path.env

Then after running it both ways you should have a file for each PID that
did it that you can compare.

I bought a $40 Dell Latitude E6400 without harddisk:
    - Core 2 Duo P8400, 2GB DDR2-800, 1280x800 screen
    - DVD-RW, battery, 130W power adapter
    - SATA interface for disk

      down, but return is very crisp.  This was main reason for buying
      it.
I added SSD, and installed Windows-10 to see if all components are
working.  And, they were.  Then, I decided to upgrade its old BIOS (from
A14 to A34).  Windows gave me error, and told me to reboot.  Well, now,
the laptop won't boot!

So, it's free for anyone needing parts.  I can bring it to next TLUG

Hello William,

Please reply off list to confirm.

Also, do you happen to know if it has a Serial Port.

It's not a problem if it doesn't, however.

Please ask if you need me to give you an E-Mail Address to contact me.

Cheers,
Amos

Subject: [GTALUG] Dell Latitude E6400 -- free

I bought a $40 Dell Latitude E6400 without harddisk:
    - Core 2 Duo P8400, 2GB DDR2-800, 1280x800 screen
    - DVD-RW, battery, 130W power adapter
    - SATA interface for disk
    - keyboard is better than ThinkPad T43.  A little heavier going
      down, but return is very crisp.  This was main reason for buying
      it.
I added SSD, and installed Windows-10 to see if all components are
working.  And, they were.  Then, I decided to upgrade its old BIOS (from
A14 to A34).  Windows gave me error, and told me to reboot.  Well, now,
the laptop won't boot!

So, it's free for anyone needing parts.  I can bring it to next TLUG
meeting.

If you can still get in to BIOS, check the settings. Particularly the ones 
involving UEFI and secureboot. Someone on this list could tell you how they 
should be set to keep Windows happy.

You could also try booting a live Linux CD or DVD to check the drives.

I can't even get to BIOS.  Power LED comes on and few other keyboard
related LEDs.  Then, it turns off.

KOrganizer is a calendar program in KDE.  And, it's the only thing

What calendar program do you guys use in other desktops?  I know of and

    - Evolution (GNOME)

I rarely use my desktop calendar anymore (I like the simplicity of the
mobile apps better). But the ones I use on my desktop are:

khal <https://github.com/geier/khal> - a console based calendar
application that uses vdirsyncer
<https://github.com/untitaker/vdirsyncer> to sync CalDAV based calendars.

Lighting Calendar <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/projects/calendar/> - a
Thunderbird extension the provides a really good calendar app.

I use Google Calendar, which is brilliant AND co-ordinates with my
phone.  It also gives my entire life schedule to Google, totally
compromising my privacy.  I suspect you're being more reasonable and
avoiding this route: more power to you.  Sadly, all calendars in my
life are now measured by the great - but privacy destroying - Google
Calendar, and all others have failed.  <sigh>

I use ownCloud as my CalDAV server, which has a decent web UI when I'm away from
one of my primary computers.

My primary desktop calendar client is Lighting inside IceDove.

I wrote about my experience degooglifying my calendar a few years ago:
http://blaise.ca/blog/2013/05/18/degooglifying-part-iv-calendar/

tldr: it's totally possible to use a CalDAV server like ownCloud, and sync with
Android using Davdroid, and use other CalDAV clients on the desktop like Lightning.

"You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it." Scott McNealy 1999

"The future is already here -- it's just not very evenly
distributed" William Gibson 1993

I dispair of privacy but am fighting a rear-guard action.  iOS and
Android leak stuff like crazy, but what's the mobile alternative?

Now desktops are copying this.  And not just browsers.  Windows 10
appears as bad as Android and iOS.  Simple example: Microsoft gets
information about all the programs you run and that cannot be turned
off (it could be firewalled surely).  Your OS as an Advanced
Persistent Threat.

Many, but not all, of these leaks come with advantages to the user.
For example, Cortana, Siri, and Google Now(?) may be fun but they are
always listening to you and sending something home.  Google (and
other) search have to send the queries upstream.

If I remember correctly, on a recent update, I had to give Google
Slides general permission to use the microphone.  Huh?

Our legal system doesn't provide tools and norms to limit the damage.
We need mandated and enforce limitations on information flows within
organizations as well as between organizations.  This is going to be
hard since Big Data is such a thing.  And specifict consent should be
required.

I really don't like it that our desktops are becoming treacherous
devices, following our smartphones.

Has anyone checked out/backed Mycroft on Kickstarter

Actually, the LTS update path is from 12.04 LTS to 14.04 LTS as one
step.  There was no LTS between these.  Perhaps less visible is that
the first time migration is suggested is when 14.04.1 LTS was
released, not 14.04.  So no, what I did was purely by the book.

Ubuntu understands and promotes the LTS-only approach

Window frequently invents new ways not getting along with Linux, often
related to booting.  Many of the newer and more mysterious ones
involve UEFI.  For one thing, all systems need to share /boot/efi.

Thanks for the grub hints (not quoted).  Grub is a complex, powerful,
and idiosyncratic tool doing a confusing task.  And since it usually
works we have little incentive to learn of its commands.

It turns out that the "grub rescue>" prompt isn't totally useless.
Most of the Grub machinery isn't available, but there is enough that
one might be able to climb out of the hole.

Useful lore.

| Boot-Repair <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair> on a
| bootable USB stick will likely fix it.

OK.  I'm partway into getting a USB stick for Ubuntu 14.04.3.

Negative observation four:  ubuntu mirrors are inconsistent.
	<http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.3/>
and	<http://mirror.pnl.gov/releases/14.04.3/>
are not the same as
	<http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-cdimages/14.04.3/release/>
but it is close enough to be confusing.
	ubuntu-14.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso
is in the first two but not the last.
(I usually go to a separate mirror for the .iso and the SHA256SUM)

Negative observation five++: although the .iso is only 1G, the Ubuntu 
Startup Disk Creator said my 4G USB stick was too small.  It even said 
that my 8G stick was too small until I tried enough times and ways.  And 
then, after perhaps 10 minutes, it asked for a password to install the 
bootloader (why is that more special than formatting the drive?) and then 
said that it failed to install the bootloader.  Probably this 5 year old 
bug:
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/usb-creator/+bug/859539>
You can see from #6 that I hit this before.
The virtually secret log ~/.cache/usb-creator.log isn't helpful.
Seems to be some kind of dbus timeout.
the logfile seems to never be emptied!  I have entries from 2013!

So I invoked usb-creator-gtk from an xterm, with secret flag 
--alow-system-internal
Now it won't work because the USB partition /dev/sdb1 is mounted.
I cannot unmount it with sudo umount /dev/sdb1.
Ejecting makes it unavailable.
dd'ing a couple of megs of zeros to /dev/sdb leaves it unperturbed.

The final trick was to format the USB drive with the desktop's formatter 
and not have usb-creator-gtk do the formatting.  My guess is that
there was some race between useb-creator-gtk and "the desktop".

This stick is now nicely bootable.  I booted it, installed boot-repair
on the stick (why isn't this part of Ubuntu?), and ran it.  The result
worked -- I could boot Ubuntu 14.04 from the hard drive!

The Grub menu was a mess but it was correct.  I fixed that from
within the installed system.

Negative observation 6:  The updated-to-14.04 system had some ugly
console messages during booting and they didn't go away.  Putting one
into google, I got a hit in German and guessed what it meant.
Apparently HAL isn't used any longer and one of its udev rules
(70-something) didn't follow modern standards.  The cure was to
"apt-get remove hal".  How would a normal user figure this out?

| Under certain circumstances,
| Windows updates will routinely destroy grub, so keep this stick handy.

I booted Ubuntu 12.04 after Win 7 updates.  So that isn't a good excuse 
this time.

Ubuntu phone, now available outside Europe:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/11/ubuntu_phone_global_sales/

Note that while you can buy it, connectivity in the U.S. (which
probably means Canada too) may be spotty.  The larger 5" model is 200
euros, which currently translates to $290 Canadian - although that
doesn't include tax or shipping.  I'll be watching this closely: I
have an intense aversion to Android and Google's snooping habits, and
the idea of a Linux phone is very appealing.

I'm not good at reading the standards and I don't care much about data
plans (in fact I don't use them on my phone, only voice and Wifi).
How well would this behave in Canada?

Android is Linux... just swapping Google's proprietary OS for a mix of free
software and Canonical proprietary stuff? Still, an Ubuntu base seems far
better. Though Canonical lost my trust on privacy with the Amazon dash thing --
they don't exactly have a stellar reputation on privacy either, even though
they're miles away from Google.

"Specifically, both phones support 2G GSM on the 850/900/1800/1900MHz bands and
3G HSPA+ on the 900/2100MHz bands."

I think with that's Robelus (well, specifically Rogers for 2G GSM I think... but
seems like Bell or TELUS for 3G would be options).

No WIND (or other newer carriers), which use AWS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Wireless_Services#Canada


Which... is disappointing, because I'm never going back (to Rogers/Robelus) if I
can at all avoid it.

My problem is that I am planning ahead in about 2 year blocks where there
are
a lot of things that I am tracking and noting most of which are related (and
inter-related).

I wish there were an option besides Google calendar too - - - maybe its
time that someone wrote one!

(Wish that could be me but I have never done any programming yet!)

After my update from Ubuntu 12.04 to 14.04, apt-get tells me that there 
are a lot of packages that apt-get auto-remove could remove.

Is that safe?  What is the underlying idea?

I think that it removes things that were added due to dependencies where 
those dependencies no longer exist.  In the back of my mind, I worry that 
sometimes dependencies might be things that I wanted independently of why 
they were installed, but I'm not sure of that.

Do people fine apt-get auto-remove works great or do you find that it 
throws a few babies out with the bathwater?

Some people have managed to get it to reflash the failed update to A34
by putting the bios on a 2GB or smaller USB key and holding down END
key while turning it on.  You have to put the HDR and ROM files on the
USB key.

Apparently failling while updating to A34 has happened quite a bit.

I wouldn't completely trust autoremove, as once it tried to
automatically remove X-related packages from my desktop system.

I figured the way autoremove works -- it gives a best guess of what is
not needed, but that guess can sometimes be wrong, you should always
review the package list and be extra suspicious when apt-get tries to
remove hundreds of packages. Generally, system works well for removing
old versions of libraries.

If autoremove is nagging you too much -- just run 'apt-get install
<packagename autoremove doesn't like>' and that will solve the problem.
Nothing will get installed or removed but the package will be ignored by
autoremove in the future.

Yes.  The idea is that libraries and such that were dependancies of foo
version x and no longer needed by foo version y, so nothing depends
on them anymore, and since you did not explicitly ask for them to be
installed (they were installed automatically to solve dependancies)
they can now be removed.

There is no guessing involved.

Now if you remove something somehow that means the rest of your desktop
is no longer explicitly installed or required by something explicitly
installed, then yes it will think it should be removed, since that is
in fact correct for the currently requested packages.  Simple enough to
fix by just saying:

Agreed.

The only way in which it's (rarely) a pain is if you accidentally uninstalled a
package that then uninstalls another package, messing with your intended
setup... e.g. common example is (was?) trying to remove Evolution, which is a
depenedency of some GNOME stuff. So if you uninstall Evolution, then it
uninstalls some GNOME metapackages, and then a bunch of other GNOME packages
which you still might want are suddenly "no longer required" because you don't
have the meta package.

But the problem there is not with autoremove, it's with the fact that GNOME
requires Evolution. autoremove's behaviour is useful there; the Evolution
dependency is the PITA.


Why don't you just see what packages it's going to uninstall?

Usually it lists them, but you can also run something like:
`sudo apt-get autoremove --dry-run`

I've almost never had a problem (I can't remember a specific case). But if you
do, you can then just mark the packages you want to keep as manually install (by
running `sudo apt-get install packageiactuallywanttokeep`), and then go back to
autoremove.


Also, worst-case scenario, you can just reinstall a package.

I've done pretty much what Blaise has done. Calendar was the last
Google service I got rid of, since Google does CALSCH (Calendaring and
Scheduling) really well, and follows iCalendar standards (or used to;
now Lightning requires a "Google Calendar Provider" plugin to make
Google work as a calendar repository).

I was already using Thunderbird and Lightning as my desktop calendar
tools, so I installed ownCloud to provide a calendar repository to
replace Google. Works great! I think the ownCloud calendar web
interface is awful, though. But then I found that ownCloud was useful
for file sync between desktops too, so bonus!

Haven't had much success with CalDAV clients on my Android phone
(which is Google-free; FDroid only).  But that may be because I'm
still using Cyanogenmod 7.2, the equivalent of Gingerbread (Android
2.3.7). Sadly, there's nothing more recent available for my phone (LG
P999) because of the proprietary AWS radio which I need for Wind Mobile.

And kudos to Hugh for fighting the good privacy fight!

Extract the bios files:

E6400A34.EXE -writehdrfile

This even works with wine:
# wine E6400A34.exe -writehdrfile

resulting in:
$ file E64*
E6400A34.exe: MS-DOS executable
E6400A34.hdr: Dell system BIOS version A34

Then place the resulting file on a usb key that is no more than 2GB
(probably needs to be FAT16 is my guess).

Unplug battery and power, then insert usb key, hold END key, and plug
in power (leave battery out apparently), battery light should go red,
release END key, and it should reflash the bios again.  At least as far
as I understand the instructions.

I have not yet had a problem where autoremove made something go away which I 
still needed. If in doubt, get the list of packages that will be removed and 
look them up in Synaptic to see if any of them are something you think you 
are currently using, or are likely to be using soon.

I don't have much use for a calendar program on my main computer. I mostly 
use my PDA for calendar related items. If I was to use a program I would 
just use the calendar feature in Thunderbird as that program is usually 
running when I'm logged in to my desktop.

And if you want I can email you the .hdr file if that is simpler.

I have ThinkPad T43 (Windows 10) fortunately.  I extracted HDR file,
copied to 256MB usb stick (FAT16), and booted per instruction.  The
battery LED flashes orange/blue (blue is default colour)... it's been
flashing for 2 hours. :-(

Keyboard LEDs are diagnostic LEDs during POST, and they say I may have
processor failure.  What a shame... its keyboard is the best laptop
keyboard I came across.

Hello William,

You can drop it off at Bill's if that is more convienent than bringing it to the GTALUG Meeting.

Either way works for me.

Thanks for the tip Mauro, Lennart! It turns out the problem was with not 
having the DISPLAY variable set properly.  So in lockkde.sh I invoke 
qdbus this way

Konsole output
DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock

And now it works!

Thanks again,

Randy

So holding the END key while plugging in power does nothing?

That's a shame.  It is suspicious that if failed at the same time you
upgraded the BIOS.

It's sorta cute, though I'd think it somewhat uninteresting as an
"artificial
intelligence," basically on the basis that I don't think voice recognition
is a terribly wonderful direction to go.  Open-ended, but perhaps too
much so to do things I'd *care* about.

As near as I can tell, the voice recognition in these products has been
pretty nearly useless.  There are cruel drive-by pranks to the effect of
"Siri, find all the [offensive material on phone].  Forward as email to
Mom."  I'd expect the process to fail because it failed to recognize
one word.

Voice recognition has improved, but it still tends to be laughably
bad.

The part of Google New that seems pretty useful is the aspect of it
having a whole bunch of forms of "useful-things-to-do-with-patterns"
recognition that point at various sorts of event streams to output
"you might care about this soon".

Thus...
- Noticing that you stopped driving (due to change in velocity), and
  noting that location as a probable recent parking spot.
  Thank you for automatically remembering my parking spot.
- Rummaging through mailbox and noticing emails containing
  shipment identifiers, and pointing that out.
  Thank you for tracking where my "goods to be delivered" are.
- Rummaging through calendar and noting that they're coming
  up.
- Further to that, checking addresses against current
  location, and warning when I need to leave to get there.
- Further to that, checking for traffic difficulties and warning
  of traffic jams, slowdowns, ad infinitum.
- Rummaging through mailbox, noticing emails from
  airlines about upcoming flights, and reporting about
  FLIFO (flight info)
- For sports fans, reporting results of recent games relating
  to favorite teams.
- Weather updates, including local warnings of major adverse
  weather events (storms, tornados, and such)

This notion of integrating together the "bread crumbs" of things
that are worth being reminded about seems to me to be the
Next Wave of useful Artificial Intelligence, and it's nothing
to do with voice recognition.

It's actually not forcibly about needing to share ALL your data
with a Google or such; to have your own daemon reading through
your email or calendar looking for things of interest is quite
plausible.  Such processes are sufficiently messy that
I can easily see central processors having some advantage
as they can be pointed at enough messy data sources to
get debugged more successfully than my half-baked wee
script.  I'll bet there are some poor script writers at Google
balking at new emails coming from airlines, but perhaps
better that than me deciding to not bother.

I'll toss out that a recent "rather creepy TMI thing" didn't have
an Evil Central Authority as its cause...

- My phone started warning me about an impending
  flight from Philadelphia to Seattle
- As this wasn't my plan, I started poking at why...
- Apparently a "Christine Browne" accidentally put my
  email address as her contact address for her frequent
  flyer program.  (No relation; caused by typo...)
- Fun ensues as I'm getting way Too Much Information
  from her airline about her family's vacation plans.

For further fun in the matter, I could have used the
access that I was given to muss around with the
whole family's seating on their flights.  And there
seemed to be some baggage-related exploits.  Which
is a security weakness on the part of the airline, but
induced by incorrect authentication information.

I just felt safer stepping through all the versions between where I was the 
where I wanted to be. Mainly this was from when I had been on Fedora. Might 
be easier if they properly support jumping from LTS to LTS.

Under grub 1 some built in commands/features let you get grub to boot the 
machine either after a kernel update or a typo slipped in to grubs boot 
menu. I can't recall having ever used a grub prompt to get a machine to boot 
since I was forced to start using grub 2.

I may be partly lucky. It may be due to my trying to avoid touching the 
grub.cfg file now that grub 2 made its boot configuration files so 
complicated compared to the ones used with grub 1.

Subject: [GTALUG] hardware inventory -- what's in my machine?
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1508161539160.1557@redclaw.mimosa.com>

Sometimes I don't remember what's in each of my machines.

Here's what I use to figure this out:

- taking the machine apart (often inconvenient)

- dmesg(8) shows the kernel log.  If nothing has flooded the log it
  will still have the messages from the booting.  You can see entries
  from the kernel's discovery of most resources.  Downside: it is long
  and arcane.  Upside: you might find some surprises (eg. warnings).

- dmidecode(8) "DMI table decoder".  The output is a little arcane but 
  useful.  The man page says that it can be unreliable.

- (new to me) lshw(1) "list hardware".  The output seems easier to read 
  that dmidecode's.  It uses a variety of sources.  It can output in a
  bunch of formats (but I've ignored that).

- /proc/cpuinfo will tell you about the CPU.  Apparently lscpu(1)
  shows pretty much the same thing (I've never noticed it before).

- /proc/meminfo will tell you how much RAM you have (MemTotal is
  roughly the physical RAM, after some overhead has been removed).

- /var/log/Xorg.0.log: shows what devices and capabilities X has
  found.  Hard to read but sometimes it's what you need.

- lsusb(8): list USB devices (including hubs).

- lspci(8): list PCI devices and buses

- sdparm(8)/hdparm(8): show (or set!) parameters of disk drive.
  hdparm seems to be mostly obsolete.  This will tell you stuff:
	sudo sdparm -i /dev/sda

- smartctl(8) "SMART Monitoring Tools".  SMART == Self-Monitoring,
  Analysis and Reporting Technology.  This is about disk drive issues.
  This command will pour out a lot of information:
	sudo smartctl -x /dev/sda

Hugh,

   I have installation instructions written up for each of my machines, which I post on my website.  Among other things, I list the hardware contained in each machine.

Thanks.

Here's a slightly shorter version.  Picky, picky, picky.  Looking gift 
horse in the mouth.

I try to start all my scripts with "set -eu" so that more bugs will be
detected.

"set -e" causes the shell to exit if a command unexpectedly fails.
That is, a command returns non-zero and was invoked in a non-test
context.  Just what you want.

"set -u" tells the shell to treat a reference to an undefined
parameter as an error.  It will make no difference in this script.
Until the script evolves more complexity.

     It only causes the shell to exit if a simple command fails.

     Best practice is not to use it at all.

    There's no point to using set -u after a script has been debugged.

Greetings

Managed to buy a Dell poweredge 2950II server.

What an odyssey to set up the bios!!!

I have 2 drives I got with the machine - - - they were part of a Raid 5
array.
Now there are only 2 drives (will never by a raid 5 array by definition)
and I need some way of formatting them so that I can turn them into a Raid
1 array. (Its all hardware raid on this box.)

Anyone with any idea on how to do that to scsi drives when the controller
won't let me change their settings and I have no other pox to put them in.
(Connector is a wee bit different than for SATA!)

The sad fact is that I don't know when I've gotten rid of the last bug
in a script.

It's really handy to have this on: I then know that most typos in
parameter names will be caught so when I have a bug, I don't have to
check for that kind of error myself and can concentrate on looking for
other pathologies.  Silently replacing a reference to a non-existent
parameter with nothing is just dumb human engineering.

I cannot find the Hoare quote that I'm looking for, but this seems to
be a mangled version of it:

	Once said that removing type checking from your running programs and
	using them only for testing is like wearing a life jacket on your
	practice emergency drills and taking them off as soon as your ship was
	really sinking.

<http://blog.mattcallanan.net/2010/09/tony-hoare-billion-dollar-mistake.html>

Another relevant quote:

	a programming language designer should be responsible for the
	mistakes that are made by the programmers using the language

(Hoare is a real great of our field.)

So many warning signs.  But I'll ignore them.  

1) why won't the controller let you change the settings?  That seems
   wrong.  Maybe you are missing some admin software.

2) Desperate attempt:
   Can you boot from a live USB stick?  If so, can you "see through"
   the RAID controller to the raw disks?  If so, perhaps you can
   scribble a copy of /dev/zero over the raw disks.  The RAID config
   information is somewhere on that raw disk and if you can obliterate
   it, surely the controller will let you re-configurate.

   If you cannot do it with the contoller you have, buy a SCSI
   controller from the surplus/used source.  They ought to cost 
   a small amount since everyone is ditching SCSI.

   Overwriting a modern high-capacity disk can take perhaps half a
   day.  But I suspect your disks are neither modern nor
   high-capacity.

Greetings

Managed to buy a Dell poweredge 2950II server.

What an odyssey to set up the bios!!!

I have 2 drives I got with the machine - - - they were part of a Raid 5 array.
Now there are only 2 drives (will never by a raid 5 array by definition) and I need some way of formatting them so that I can turn them into a Raid 1 array. (Its all hardware raid on this box.)

Anyone with any idea on how to do that to scsi drives when the controller won't let me change their settings and I have no other pox to put them in. (Connector is a wee bit different than for SATA!)

I don't know when I've gotten the last bug in *any* language (of course
I've only been programming for 44 years, so maybe I'll get to that point
sometime :-).

The only reason I can even *imagine* turning it off after "debugging" would
be a claim for "efficiency".  And to suggest that "the overhead of having
the bash interpreter check this" is material is misguided (see Hugh's
quotes from Tony Hoare).  There are *very*, *very* few programs that need
that kind of micro-efficiency, which is why I virtually never program in C
or C++ anymore -- safety is so much more important.

That's my fault for trimming too much.  Please look back to the
previous message (I don't like endless non-targetted quoting).

This part was about "set -e".

Chris points out that the limitations of -e are not obvious and
concludes that the feature is best avoided.  The main non-obvious
limitation seems to be that failing subshells don't cause the script
to stop.  Remember that pipelines include subshells.

If there's a hardware RAID controller it may need its battery changed
(if it has one). Some RAID controllers keep the config in NVRAM, so
/dev/zero may not help that much.  If the drives are recognized by
the OS it may be better to use OS RAID, and eliminate the dependency on
potentially flakey, unreplaceable hardware.

Certainly some raid controllers have an initialize option you can apply
to disks to clean them so they can be reused in a new raid.

No idea which raid controller model you are dealing with.

Not a bad idea - - except Dell manuals are a joke.
There is absolutely no information that I could find using both Duckduck
and ms google on how to setup the BIOS (and its absolutely NOT intuitive!!).
Don't you just love computers that require half a dozen training courses to
use!

Upgrading the firmware is also a very good idea but to do so I first have
to install MS windows on the machine as the upgrade package is a .exe file.
That's sort of interesting when they tell you about RHEL, SUSE and a third
Linux operating system option for the server itself. So although I would
love to upgrade the firmware I'm not sure how I can actually do it - - -
that may be why it hadn't been upgraded previously!

Thanks for the ideas!

You have found the problem - - - the OS does NOT recognize the drives at
all.

If I could have found the hard drives from the OS I would not have bothered
using
hardware RAID - - - prefer the software RAID myself and have been using it
for
a while so am somewhat comfortable with it.

Ah yes.  Those.  It Might Be Dead.

(A past gig had a lot of Dell servers, an annoying number of which were
suffering from dead RAID controllers and/or remote consoles, while the
IBM, HP, and Sun hardware generally just kept working.)

However, the various hardware RAID controllers I've had to deal with
always had a BIOS screen (usually a pause during boot telling you hit
some key combo to enter RAID config) and you need to get into that to
tell it to forget the old setup and usefully configure (mirror, stripe,
or JBOD) the drives it has now.  This will also confirm it does actually
see them.  After that's done, it should present its virtual drive(s) to
the OS.

That would be SAS.  SAS controllers can run SATA disks, but no the other
way around.

Well here is a handy video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5lGWdvJyS4

It seems you hit control-r to enter the raid setup when prompted, then
in there there is a PD management tab (PD = physical disk I suspect)

Looks like control-n is how to change tabs.

I found a page that says if you see 'foreign' config present, then you
can hit F2 on the controller on the VD management page and ask it to
clear that.

Certainly if you check in the control-r setup and don't see PD count
of 2, then there is a problem with the controller detecting the disks.
If it does show 2, then it should be fixable.

Apparently the Perc 5/i can't do JBOD.  The standard work around appears
to be to create a 1 disk RAID0 on each drive and use those as the disks.

Well - - I would not have thought of that.

As I wanted 4 discs on a Raid 10 and 2 on a Raid 1 I think I am happy with
how
things have worked out.

Now if this system craters then I do know that the next purchase will be a
little
different. I like the processors in this box but the bios is a royal pita
and some
of the other decisions make by the system designers choices do leave
something
to be desired.

Thanks for the help and information!

Thank you very much!!

This last bit of information was what enabled me to finish my system setup.

So - - - procedure followed:

1. Ctrl R to get into the RAID utility
2. Use Ctrl-N to get to the Virtual Disk page
3. Move cursor to the line (controller) that has the word 'foreign' in it.
4. F2 will then take to where it asks if you want to initiailize and
something else that I have now forgotten.

With the initialization one can now set up a new array (in my case a RAID 1
(for data security)).

So thank you all for your various tips and assistance - - - I now have a
server with 6 disks running OpenMediaVault.

(Now if there just were someway to get this ancient BIOS to recognize discs
of great than 2 TB in size and if there were a way to update the BIOS
without needing to run MS windows things would be real real good!)

http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=16RCK
says you can get the PE2950-020700CBIOS.exe file and put it on a USB
bootable key with DOS (freedos should work) and use that to flash
the BIOS.

Pretty sure unetbootin can create such a thing for you.

Thanks for setting this up!

Great feature: the yelp link in each entry.

I think that Doner Kebab House is just a duplicate of Donair Kebab
House.

Kathy's Corner seems to mostly be rotisserie chicken (not sandwiches)
judging by yelp.

Beware: sessions time out.  I voted but the result was ignored.  I had
the screen up for a few hours but I didn't know that this was a
problem.

The left column is called "Your choices" but it actually lists the
restaurants you haven't chosen.

Korean Grill House seems to be cooked by the customer, at the table.
One choice is "all you can eat".  As much fun as that is, I'm not sure
that's great for finishing on time or being awake in the meeting (I
admit I'm not good at that).

This is fun (I haven't finished).  I never realized that it was so
hard to rank things versus just vote for one.  Algorithmically,
selecting is O(n) but ranking is O(n log n).  But that assumes that
comparing is O(1); it seems not to be a bit worse.

So emphasis on "choices" as in the choices you have to pick from, rather
than emphasis on "your" as in the choices you have made.

Subject: [GTALUG] NetworkManager scans wireless every 2min -- solution
	(finally)
Message-ID: <20150819233607.GA6283@node1.localdomain>

My wireless connection crawls for 20sec every 2min.  NetworkManager was
scanning my wireless network every 2min (iwevent says so).  The problem
is that the scan lasts 20sec, and during that 20sec, I get the following
dmesg messages:

    ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00queue_flush_queue: Warning - Queue 2 failed to flush

and my connection crawls.  The card is Linksys WMP600N (rt2800pci).

I tried different kernels, different driver settings, different
NetworkManager configurations, etc.  Since it's the only wireless card I
have, I couldn't try different card and didn't feel like buying another.

Finally, an accidental click led me to a solution:
    To prevent NetworkManager from scanning, set BSSID to the MAC
    address of access point.

I use wicd as an alternative to Network Manager.  This is only possible in 
some distros unfortunately as Network Manager is so integrated in some 
cases that it can't be removed without ripping out the entire desktop.
