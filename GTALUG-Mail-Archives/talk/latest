# OpenStreetMap with Stewart Russell

OpenStreetMap is more than just a web mapping platform. It's a
comprehensive, community-maintained map/geodatabase of the world that
you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years
ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers,
developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of
using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little
drama, and how it succeeds as a community.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before the meeting a group of GTALUGers will be dining at
It's All Grk (101 Dundas St East).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East).

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members @

12th :)
