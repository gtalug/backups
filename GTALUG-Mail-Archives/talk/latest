All newspaper websites have to compete for clicks, especially when faced
with the brutal onslaught that is the Daily Mail. The Guardian is run by
an independent foundation, and is able to carry stories (like the whole
Wikileaks/Snowden thing) that others won't touch. It's also (formerly)
famous for its lack of proof-reading, hence its nickname, The Grauniad.

The Globe and Mail used to share more stories with the Guardian, but
ever since the Globe lurched more to the right, these have tapered off
to nothing.

A new Raspberry Pi 2 is set for release with a new Broadcom BCM2836 quad
core Cortex A7:

http://www.cnx-software.com/2015/02/02/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/

My understanding is this new RPi moves to ARMv7 and I will be able to run
the vanilla ARM release of Debian Jessie?

Fellow netheads:


Schedule:
==========================
The schedule is out.  It is currently a graphic image, but we are
working on a proper non-graphic rendered clickable version.
	https://www.netdev01.org/schedule


Registration:
==========================
There was a glitch in the registration web site yesterday.  We apologize
for the inconvenience and it is now working again.  Please try again if
you had difficulty.
https://onlineregistrations.ca/netdev01/
$100/day, or $350 for 4 days (Cdn dollars). (online reg closes Feb 12th)
Please register as early as practical.  Registering helps us plan properly for
numbers of attendees, ensuring venue sizes and supplies are appropriate without
wasting resources.


Hotel discount rates deadline extended
==========================
The Westin Hotel is still holding a block of rooms for Netdev01 at a
guaranteed rate of $159.00 or $179.00 (depending on the type of room
required) and there are still a few rooms available.
We've been able to negotiate an extention to the block of rooms at the
hotel earlybird special rates beyond the discount rate deadline, but
when they are gone, they are gone.  There were still several people able
to register over the weekend.
There are lots of big and small hotels in Ottawa, but they will fill up
fast as Winterlude approaches, so book something soon.  There may be
some possibilities to billet locally, but don't leave it last minute.
Make your reservations at:

I dunno, the Raspberry Pi Foundation works pretty closely with Broadcom,
and also with Microsoft on supporting Windows 10. This would have taken
some planning, and I'm not sure that they consider Odroid to be a
competitor.

The real question is, is the new machine:
* The Raspberry Pi ? (for those who feel that it's
  necessary to have ? = 2?), or
* The Raspberry Pi 10 (since ?? ? 10, for most engineering purposes)

Enquiring Minds Want To Know!

# Round Table Q&A Session

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.


## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:

Well except the kernel, which will obviously not support this new chip yet.

But other than that, it very well might work.

I'm in for that!

But just to clarify, a formal key signing doesn't need government issued ID. The formality stems from the use of a keysigning key (one specially generated to sign the keys of the participants), and that each participant reads out his/her key fingerprint, and is vouched for by other participants who know him/her.

I went back to the store to re-examine the T410 more closely and to look 
into the T420 as someone suggested. My attention switched to a T520 that 
he had available for $20 more than the T410. It has Intel wifi 
(Centrino) and switchable graphics (Intel & Nvidia). It presently has 
nvidia but he said I could get intel graphics instead. I don't know if 
this switchable thing means that I can swap graphics cards.

Unless someone sounds an alarm soon, I'll be buying the T520 later in 
the week.

Thanks,

John.

The T420/T520 like the T430/T530 should have nvidia optimus, which
means it has both intel and nvidia graphics, and switches on the fly
when asked to.

You can select in the BIOS which one it should enable by default at boot.

Obviously when the nvidia is off and the intel only in use, the battery
life is a lot better.

For that matter I believe even the T410/T510 has nvidia optimus.

Message-ID: <54D04CE5.9090005@dinamis.com>

Hello All,

I have an invite for a One Plus One phone to give away. The first person
to respond to me privately and actually wants to buy the phone for
personal use gets it. I'm not charging anything for it and trust that
you won't be selling the invitation. You must use the invite before 8:30
am on Tuesday. If I don't hear from anyone in the next couple of hours,
I'll just post it on the forums on the OPO site.

I have the 64GB sandstone black model with the OPO flip case. It was
US$391.38 including DHL shipping. I ordered on a Wednesday morning and
had the phone in my hands on Friday afternoon after paying another
C$64.90 in customs brokerage fees, HST, and duties. I'm very happy with
the phone and I'd recommend it.

To me, the display resolution is important.  You can get anything from
1366x768, 1440x900(?), 1920x1080.  There may be an IPS screen option
too, which is quite nice.  You haven't mentioned the resolutions on
the models you are considering.  Does it not matter to you?

The Intel + Nvidia choice is probably better than straight Intel.
After all, you can chose which to use (as Lennart pointed out).  For
my use, the Nvidia would probably not be important, but I'd take it if
it was inexpensive or free.

Clearly the T4x0 is easier to carry than the T5x0.

We have T520, W520, and T530 and they seem to be pretty good
workhorses.  But my main notebook is a Lenovo Yoga 2 pro and that is
much better as a portable device (more screen resolution, lighter,
thinner, longer battery life).  As workstations, the Thinkpads are
much more powerful and upgradeable/repairable.

Though the X series is supposed to be the easiest to carry.  I have
memories of jogging around Ottawa with an old A-series Thinkpad on
my back, and I was younger back then.

I've tended toward the laptop being for away only, and a proper desktop
machine at home, but laptop performance has gotten up to the point of
making sense as a primary machine, and then there isn't the hassle of
maintaining two systems and the laptop always being woefully out of date
and needing a lot of OS updates and personal file transfers when being
pulled out for a trip.

(Maybe a compute server, or render farm, at home is still an option for
the occasional thing needing a lot of horsepower...)

It looks like the X220 is the last X-series machine from before Lenovo
got silly, and the i7-based models can be had with USB3 for moving data
around.  That last feature is something I don't see on as many current
Thinkpads as I thought I should.

The screen resolution is not great but it suits my needs (1366x768). And 
it does have a multi card reader. Unfortunately, it has no USB3. The 
specs in general are good, but not the latest greatest.

Overall, I think it's not only good for my application, it's also a good 
fit for Linux (as per all the feedback, for which I am grateful as it 
puts my mind at ease).

Thanks,
John.

I seem to recall USB3 arrived with the x30 models.

I'll observe that it is now the "Restaurant Formerly Known As Love at First
Bite"; apparently changed management about 2 months ago, along with
removing the Japanese/Thai options from the menu, whilst adding a few more
grill-related things.

All said, if you search webs/maps for it, your search will most likely be
more successful looking for the old name, until such time as the new name
becomes sufficiently storied.

I haven't pay much attention to raspberry-pi before. It comes with an HDMI
port, is it?
How fast would it be to play movies from localnetwork, or play youtube
videos?

Well certainly the new version does support neon as well as vfp3/vfp4.
Of course it also still has the videocore that supports a number of video
decoding options.  Certainly doing it by CPU only was hopeless on the
original pi, but that's not what they were doing in general as far as
I know.

I see
http://www.raspi.today/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-raspberry-pis-epiphany-web-browser/
says that the original can play 720p videos from youtube and vimeo.
It may be that the new CPU cores will help it do more than that.

According to that article the codec licences are not included in the new
RPi2

But are the licences included with the Odroid, or have they just
implemented the code without paying Fraunhofer their dues?

  Depending where on the planet you are, MP3 patents may have already
expired in your jurisdiction as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Licensing_and_patent_issues
This is not legal advice; see a real lawyer for that.

# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

PodCamp[1] is a DemoCamp-like conference for people interested in 
Podcasting and general content creation on the Internet. I went a few

There's also Ethiopiques at 277 Church. It might be a bit messy for most
folks, but it's a very sociable way to dine.

If we are doing a key signing, I can also bring CACert forms. If you want
to mess around with X.509 certs at no cost, it's worth a look.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

Cyanogen mod is forking Android (we knew that) but it how seems to be a 
big-money commercial play.

And here I thought it was just a "community".

This has happened a bit in the past with a fork of XBMC.  It didn't 
turn out well.

I wonder where these millions are going?
