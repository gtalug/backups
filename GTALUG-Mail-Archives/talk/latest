There are further problems.  The deal is for a ux305ca, slightly
different.  The main challenge is that Linux is lagging on Intel
Skylake support and the ux305ca uses Skylake (a Good Thing, but
inconvenient right now).

On Fedora 23, the touchpad didn't work and the display showed up at
low resolution.  The fix is to run the rawhide kernel because it does
have some skylake fixes.  Oh, and you need to turn off Secure Boot in
the UEFI config menu (Asus boot menu).

There are still some slightly rough spots but I haven't worked at them.

- the airplane mode light (in the keycap) is on but I'm not in

Probably more when I get more experience with it.

I should add for clarity that I meant your own Asterisk/FreeSWITCH server *in
between*.

VoIP.ms still makes sense regardless of whether you're connecting to it with SIP
clients directly, or connecting to it with an Asterisk/FreeSWITCH server and
connecting your SIP clients to Asterisk/FreeSWITCH.

The latter option is more work but gives you more power; trying the former first
is a good intermediate step that can satisfy your simpler requirements fast and
defer the decision on whether or not to host your own server.

I'm not familiar with that particular wireless device, but from this page on the
Debian wiki, it looks like it requires non-free drivers, and thus the Debian
non-free repository. If you didn't specifically install those rtl files above
from a download from the non-free repository, but rather they were installed by
default, I'm imagine they're different drivers, not the non-free ones.

Anyways, seems like you might find an answer here:
https://wiki.debian.org/rtl819x

Though, ThinkPenguin sells inexpensive wireless adapters that don't require
non-free drivers:

+1 for an Ubuntu spin, like Xubuntu or Lubuntu. Or in any other distro, just set
up a lightweight desktop environment like XFCE or LXDE. Those desktop
environments are lightweight enough to run well on older hardware, yet still
familiar enough without much customization for casual former Windows users.

I've just ported several numbers to Voip.ms, and I continue to be
amazed at the features and flexibility built right into their Web
interface.  I'll be building a local phone switch server (Asterisk or
similar) sometime in the future, but for now Voip.ms provides all the
tools I require.

I've used a Cisco SPA-122 ATA and a Grandstream HT702 ATA, as well as
a Grandstream GXP280 voip phone (and a number of SIP phone
applications on computers and Android phones). All configure Caller ID
a bit differently, but I've been able to set up different Caller IDs
for each phone, even when they dial out from the same number.

One account has two different DID (Dial-In) numbers. A single phone on
that account is configured to use one number for its caller ID, but
receives calls from both DID numbers. It's a bit of a pain to switch
the caller ID to the other number, and I don't think it's really
necessary; as long as that phone can receive calls from both numbers
it doesn't matter what number it displays on outgoing calls. YMMV.

Hey Bob, any recommendations for SIP clients? Do you like the GXP device? And
which Android SIP client do you prefer?

In terms of handsets, I'm managing some Aastra 9143i handsets, which were great
for a few years but then mysteriously refuse to boot for a few weeks at a time.
I've been looking at Granstream GXP or Polycom for replacements...

On the Android side, my wife has been using CSipSimple, but I'm not sure that's
the best option. I'm getting an Android device in a few days and will begin
playing around with it. (On my N900, Maemo Fremantle has integrated SIP support
with the Phone application, and I've mostly used Ekiga as a desktop SIP client.)

On the desktop (Linux Mint Debian Edition I) I initially had the most
success with Jitsi. After some fiddling to get Ekiga to work it has
become my preferred client. I don't use it much, I'd rather talk on a
real handset. I have Linphone installed too, but I'm not sure it's
working.


> Do you like the GXP device?

The GPX280? Short answer: No. The UI on the phone is too limited to
easily get last-caller info, or add entries into the phonebook (yes, I
should be using an LDAP directory). The WebUI looks like it was made
to be compatible with Netscape 3. The caller log info is not
accessible through the WebUI. I'm sure these things can be fixed with
a firmware upgrade, but this phone is no longer sold or being
developed by Grandstream. But it works, and the sound quality is OK.

For the next installation I'm thinking of getting a cordless WiFi
enabled voip phone, something like
http://en.grandstream.net/en/ip-phones/grandstream-dp715-dect-system-base-handset.html


> And which Android SIP client do you prefer?

I was always big on the Linphone app because of its cross-platform
availability. Now that I've had a chance to use it cross-platform I'm
not very impressed at all. F'rinstance, the Android Linphone does not
have letters on the dialling keypad. Makes it too difficult for me to
type in Voice Mail passwords.

I'm now using the integrated "Internet Phone" capability in
Cyanogenmod 7.2 on my LG P999 phone. That works well, but I can tell
it drains the battery faster (the battery is already near end-of-life;
that phone is almost five years old and not supported by anybody).

I just installed CSipSimple, looks nice and clean.


Something I haven't been able to do: Call one phone from another using
voip.ms. Each phone (analog, VOIPphone or SIP client) has its own
sub-account on voip.ms, and I've assigned "Internal extensions" to
each. But I haven't figured out how to call an internal extension.
This wasn't available with the POTS we had before, so it's not a loss
in functionality, but it would be nice to get that working. Any hints?

I'm not sure about VoIP.ms, with on my FreeSWITCH setup, you can just dial the
username to dial internally. For example, dialing 'balleyne' or '223' on another
SIP client connected to our FreeSWITCH server would ring my extension. (That is,
dialing 'balleyne at thesipserver.domain.tld')

I imagine with VoIP.ms, it'd be similar, with the subaccounts as usernames?
That's be my first guess.

Looks like there's some documentation around getting an external SIP URI for
subaccounts on the VoIP.ms wiki:
http://wiki.voip.ms/article/SIP_URI#Using_your_sub_account_internal_extension

There's probably details somewhere on the wiki about making an internal call, if
their system is set up for that.

# A Journeyman's Tour of Vim with Giles Orr

We won't be covering i-a-h-j-k-l:wq, but instead looking at a variety
of commands and plugins you may not be familiar with that can make
your editor even better.  This will include a discussion of neovim,
colours, dealing with your vimrc, mappings, buffers and tabs,
sessions, plugins, VimScript, and possibly a couple other topics.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Please discuss on the general mailing list (i.e.
<talk at gtalug.org>) where you want to go for dinner.
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

Hey Bob, any recommendations for SIP clients? Do you like the GXP device? And
which Android SIP client do you prefer?

In terms of handsets, I'm managing some Aastra 9143i handsets, which were great
for a few years but then mysteriously refuse to boot for a few weeks at a time.
I've been looking at Granstream GXP or Polycom for replacements...

On the Android side, my wife has been using CSipSimple, but I'm not sure that's
the best option. I'm getting an Android device in a few days and will begin
playing around with it. (On my N900, Maemo Fremantle has integrated SIP support
with the Phone application, and I've mostly used Ekiga as a desktop SIP client.)

Happy new year Blaise, everyone,
Now that I am back in professional groove, let me speak to a couple of 
these in  context.

This certainly makes sense, and as you discovered from my list of various 
command line programs for various music creation, they are largely in stable 
Debian distributions already.

Again, you are the voice of practical reason.  granted,  I prefer 
installing the best Debian first then layering in the extras.  Some posts 
here in other therads though may suggest issues with Jessie.  I want this 
machine to automatically boot to the console, since i will not be using it 
directly.
If Jessie now makes this a challenge, what is the best  and least difficult 
solution?

Stability is 10000% the goal here, I do not want to spend  or lose allot of 
time because things do not work well together.
I am simply not that solid in Debian and have never found locally in 
person training  in the operating system.

I am really feeling that it will be easiest to add the tools like kxstudio 
and the low latency kennel to a stable established Debian floor, 
booting into the console  assured I mean.

I might be wrong, but i believe Fanci is a woman, and by her own admission 
a hobbyist in music making not a professional.  Still as I said before there 
are   so many command line tools that   do the job, those may be best 
regardless.

but this is my point, I have absolutely zero experience updating packages 
in this way,  certainly no positive efforts.
I want to build this house for what I desire and keep using that house 
as long as possible without having to upgrade every time  Debian developers 
change their hair style if that makes sense.

I have this working.  You just dial the extension you set up.  All the
extensions start with "10" and then can be whatever you like after
that.  So, I just dial "105" and the person with that extension set up
gets called.  The restriction is that both you and the person you're
contacting have to be on the same VOIP.ms server.

Any way, I discovered that voip.ms says you aren't supposed to be
charged for voip.ms to voip.ms calls even if you use the external
phone number. (though, I haven't tested it out)

Hi again  Blaise,
This one is really fun from a creative standpoint.

This is the nifty thing about creating here. do I want to create the music 
in  midi files first then turn them into notation, or the other way 
around?  decisions, decisions.

and that seems to be the challenge  some musicians I know express about the 
abc notation platform, the syntax is  perhaps too simplistic.
I wonder myself what it does  that Lillypond does not truth be told.
And again there is that creative question, which comes first the notation, 
or the music?
Peter's creative philosophy outlined in the program below is yet another 
variation.

Yet another more philosophical question I dare say largely tied to how one 
defines   their computer experiences.
I am a member of the Debian-users  discussion group  here,
lists.debian.org
It is where I heard about abc notation, and got an invitation to join 
their own  discussion group.
However Peter who wrote the other program  is directly involved in support 
and assistance.
Who is best able to fortify the user experience, the individual directly 
involved in writing the software, or others who have built tools around 
the software?
Speaking only for myself, I do not equate music making with writing 
software code, if that makes sense.
Since I am personally less worried at this stage about how the computer 
elements enter act than I am how easily I can translate music I have 
played first into printed form for other musicians to play, I suspect a 
tool that starts with midi translates into notation, then lets me do 
cleanup in something like lillypond before printing may feel more 
natural...for me.

tools abound to be sure yes.

I can only speak to how the program gets discussed.  I have personally not 
found  productive  interaction on list.
I have for example learned more here, and from the main Debian discussion 
list than I have reading posts on the ABC Notation one, but again that is 
me.
I prefer asking the most primary source about things if i can.

Joel is a fine example of primary source.  He was one of the first to 
encourage me in creating the two separate machines I am aiming for using
   ssh telnet to reach the Linux one treating it like a command line based 
server.  Letting me start in relatively known territory since I ssh 
TELNET into Freebsd and Ubuntu shell services many times a day.
  Allot of those updating Linux programs naturally think like 
programmers, and I am not one of those.

Oh yes,  Joel's program is indeed a part of Debian.  The Debian users list 
is where I   heard about the option, and met him directly.

This is also in the Debian repos.
Exactly, there are already allot of  command line tools, some tied to 
traditional midi usage, some with bridges to new avenues like Jack.
To be honest t it is sort of a Linux drawback.  there are so many items on 
the menu, one can get overwhelmed if that makes sense.

Only further supporting your  wise idea to build a strong Debian floor 
first and add the kxstudio and low latency kernels on top.

What does jack give you in any case?  By which I mean, what can you create 
musically  with it that could not be done before in your professional 
opinion?
I will visit the pages below of course, but I am wondering how it makes a 
real world difference?

Oh how funny!
no, that would be quite impossible unnecessary and counter productive.
The speakers will be connected to the Linux music machine, its what the 
m-audio card is for.  The midi keyboard will be connected to this music 
computer as well.
the ssh telnet client is not in Linux, or windows either for that matter, 
smiles.

Now off to answer in part my own question about jack.

Greetings

I have been following this discussion with some interest due to both interest in
the msuical side and in the computational side.

When it comes to software there seems to be very very rarely a best AND
least difficult solution. A good solution is often a lot of work and a solution
that is 'easy' isn't often very good.

I think you can find some kind of web traingin fro RedHat and OpenSuse but
I think that's it. My experience has been gotten in this kind of fashion (using
a story to illustrate.)

A young man was hired to work in the bank (small local US bank here - -
its an OLD story!). He wanted to get ahead didn't want to appear stupid yet
wanted to learn. He had heard that the owner/manager/banker was a man of
few words but much wisdom. So he made an appointment to see his boss.
At the appointed time he arrived and was escorted into the inner sanctum.
After a brief greeting he asked, "How do I make get ahead?" having thought
that this question would give him the most mileage with the least amount of
time taken from his boss. The response, "Good decisions!" from his boss.

He left and spent time pondering this response whilst doing his work. After a
period of time he felt that he had the next question that needed his boss's
input. Again an appointment with this time the question being "How do I
know how to make good decisions?. His boss's response - - - "Experience."

Again he left and pondered further and still felt stuck. Yes he understood that
he needed good decisions to get somewhere and that it took experience to
make good decisions but He also understood that he was NOT experienced.
So he made another appointment. This time he asked "How do I get
experience so that I can make good decisions?". The response was very
pithy, being just two words - - - "Bad decisions!"

Therein lies all my experience with debian where I have been for about 10 years
now. Started well into adulthood as pcs came along when I was already in my 20s
I have found  that cycle of decisions made, found to be bad, wrong or
inadequate,
followed by my learning how to get out of the mess and then working
further to get
a solution that did/does what I want it to has become my normal.

I have worked from aptitude back to apt-get as well. Apt-get is always there,

This is a huge issue. Even better is the documentation that isn't or is for a
version that is 10 or 12 years old. I'm not sure its changeable because the
people that write the software don't care about this. Documentation is very
much an after thought, if and when it is. Hopefully you can find a guru or
mentor who is somewhat local so that you can call them easily so that you
might be ideas or help or maybe even just a shoulder to cry on. While I
think Debian is a viable operating system it does have its issues. (Please
note that I AM still using it!)

Hopefully you will persevere. It should be worth it if you do, if you don't you
will be no less frustrated than if you continue so enjoy the ride - - - it will
be interesting.

(Hoping the foregoing was encouragement rather than anything else!)

Speaking from my experience with music. You could tell someone you want
a regular 4 beat with pizzaz AND swing and I would understand that what was
on the page might be square but that I was to do x with that notation and that
would make it come alive. Western music notation has so many things it
can't notate. That's why you can get 10 different people doing something and
have30 different versions of something that's interesting!

Interesting music notated by a computer might be rather wickedly difficult
for the 'normal' musician to read and do. YMMV

Well, that was easy.  Just surprised the heck out of my wife, who
didn't believe the caller ID she saw on the phone...

But the call from downstairs in Elmira to upstairs in Elmira gets
routed through Toronto. That's kinda strange (and unwanted), but I'll
fix that when I install an Asterisk or equivalent.

Thanx, Tim!

Yup, works for me. I can make calls using the regular DID phone number
for the various voip.ms accounts I manage, and the charge is always 0.
That was an unexpected bonus!


Does anyone know if the Toronto Asterisk Users Group is still meeting?
http://taug.ca/ seems to be down...

Subject: [GTALUG] installing linux while retaining Windows 10
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1601041608150.13383@redclaw.mimosa.com>

When I buy a PC, it almost always comes with Win 10 these days and I am 
not brave enough to throw it away.  So I install Linux beside Windows.  
For this I need to shrink the Windows partition.

Windows is unwilling to shrink its NTFS partition to less than half
its original size.  That's because it has placed the Master File Table
in the middle of the partition and considers it unmovable.  There are
third party tools that can do this but I don't want to learn about
them or trust them.

So use Linux to resize the partition to give Windows less than half of
the disk.  There are a couple of tricks that you need to know.

Windows 10, by default, uses something called Fast Startup.  That
means that when you ask it to shut down, it only hibernates.  I think
that that means that if you change its partition (or any of several
other things) while it is shut down, Bad Things might happen.  I think
that it is best turn off Fast Startup before shutting down Win 10.
	Settings:
	System:
	Power and Sleep:
	Additional Power Settings:
	Choose what the power buttons do:
	Change settings that are currently unavailable:
	Under Shutdown Settings, untick: Turn on fast startup (recommended)
(I don't think that Microsoft wants you to find this.)

Shutdown Windows 10.
Boot your favourite Live linux (need not be what you install).
Run gparted to resize the NTFS partition.

SUPERSTITIOUS MODE ON /* this seems to be needed */
	Immediately shut down Linux.
	Reboot Windows (it will repair some damage caused by ntfsresize).
	Shut down Windows.
SUPERSTITIOUS MODE OFF

Install Linux however you wish to.

You can turn on Windows' fast startup.  But only if Linux and Windows
share no filesystems.

================

Alternative solution (unreliable report of Giles' approach):

Before EVER booting Wind 10, install Linux.
Win 10 first-boot process won't eat a Linux installation.

Suggestion: be brave!

If you need windows, reinstall it as a virtual machine. I've had no 
problem doing that and using the license key on the bottom of my laptop 
to activate it.

I've tried installing Win7 from original DVDs into a VirtualBox VM --
now I just get a message that I'm a criminal ("This copy of Windows is
not genuine"), with frequent popup reminders.  My mileage varied, your

That won't help in the event Hugh needs Windows to do BIOS updates.

Interesting. Just fired up mine after a few months. All is well. Did 
some OS updates, and still good. I'll put it to bed now, probably for a 
few more months.

Did you try activating it with your license key? What happens then? I 
had the same issue on a previous laptop, and the software required me to 
even call microsoft which I did, and the activation worked.

Now that is true. Caused me grief once on one machine requiring me to 
swap in a hard drive with windows on it, but still not the end of the 
world, and you can usually get through the lifetime of several laptops 
before needing to do a BIOS upgrade, so that doesn't seem a compelling 
reason to me.

I'd still recommend wiping the hard drive and installing Linux fresh.

As I recall, I installed it from orginal DVDs that came with the
laptop, and used the license key packaged with them. It must have
worked at one time. But like you, it lies dormant most of the time,
and I don't recall when it stopped working properly.

My guess is that it's an OEM version, looking for specific hardware
components it can't find in the VM. But I can't be bothered buying
another copy since I only fire it up every so often to see if it's
still broken.

Hi Hugh:

Do you have room for a second HD? My linux boots from a different HD, and the 
only thing modified on the Windows HD is the MBR. Been doing it that way for 
years, with W7, and now with W10 installed.

This way you do not need to do anything to the main HD, and you can render unto 
Gatesware that which belongs to Gatesware.

Anyone else buy this laptop and is installing Ubuntu 15.10 on it?

I've found that the touchpad doesn't work, but the touch screen does.
I read that the touchpad should work with the latest 4.4-RC but I
haven't had time to try upgrading the kernel.  I'm also having the
same issue with the light being on for the "airplane mode" and that
button does nothing (so can't turn off wifi/bluetooth with it).  I
managed to get the screen ratio to a reasonable setting (it defaults
to tiny-tiny everything).

Only if you need regular access to Windows. If it's infrequent (i.e. just not
brave enough to wipe it in case it might one day ever be needed), you could swap
drives in that rare case when it's needed for something.

Or, will Windows 10 boot from an external USB drive? Hardware would be the
same... I haven't used Windows since XP, so not sure if more recent control
measures would freak out over that... If that's an option, you could just put
the second drive in an external USB enclosure.

Hi Tim.

Yup, same laptop, same OS, same problems.  I've mostly kept the screen
at the native resolution and found ways to increase the font sizes in
Firefox and xterm.  But I keep arandr available for when my eyes get
tired of "tiny-tiny."  I'm probably going to wait a couple weeks more
to see if Ubuntu ships a new kernel that supports the touchpad.
If/when I get tired of waiting, I'll look at this link again:

https://florisvanvugt.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/making-asus-ux305ca-touchpad-work-in-ubuntu/

How to compile a custom kernel with a bit of a hack to fix the
touchpad.  Specific to our laptop and OS.

I recommend reading the reddit thread Hugh cited at the beginning of
this discussion and following the suggestions there to increase the
battery life: it made a massive difference (+100% or so).  Do a little
homework though: I found his settings a bit aggressive and have
probably improved battery life by letting the laptop be "sluggish" as
he puts it.  What he considers "sluggish" I consider "just fine"
because I'm mostly using a text editor in a terminal.  :-)

I'm not sure what you did, but what worked amazing for me was going to
"System Settings" > "Screen Display" and moving the "Scale for menu
and title bars" to "2".  It sounds like it should only be affecting
what it says, but it seemed to make pretty much everything work
properly.  Both Chrome and Firefox will make use of that setting.
(unfortunately it doesn't seem to apply to the initial login screen,
though)

If I were Sir Humphry, I'd be warning MS that they shouldn't hibernate 
and OS that needs to be rebooted even /occasionally/, as over time, 
every single purchase will need to reboot. Or buy a new machine (;-))

You would be surprised how many disks you can fit in some notebooks.

My wife's thinkpad T430 has 3 disks in it at the moment, while my W530
has 2 plus the DVD drive (which the T430 had to give up for a disk).

No it won't.  At least not in general.  I suspect the
enterprise/educational 'windows to go' version are the only ones that can.
So since it is a faeture of some versions, it must be an artificial
limitation Microsoft chose to implement.  Of course a USB booting install
would need to have more generic drivers available than a fixed install,
since you might be tempted to move it between computers.

Yes, I know some support multiple drives.  However, many don't.

If you unselect 'desktop' during the install, then there is no graphical
desktop, and it will boot text mode only.  Jessie is no different that
way than any other debian release ever was.

Long ago, I was able to install Windows10Enterprise (90 days trial) to
USB stick via QEMU.  I had to use VM because Windows won't install to
USB disk.  So, install went ok.  And, it boots ok. 

The problem was I couldn't do Windows Update. :-)  As you know, Windows
Update has been moved from "Control Settings" to Windows 10 "Setting"
menu.

Yeah, I got bitten by hibernation issue last week, when I was upgrading
Windows7 laptop to Windows10.  You can't mount NTFS partition when it's
hiberating!

Now, as for Linux install, I use SSD in slimstyle DVD slot, using $15
adapter.

There's an article on this at www dot howtogeek dot com

I personally think that we're better off moving tasks to open-source 
software, doing things like getting this functioning...
https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=20573

I'm in the process of trying this with the latest WINE software...

The keyboard looks pretty much exactly like the one on my W530 which I
think is a great keyboard.

The X120e keyboard is terrific. This looks like it has the same
keyboard, but the case is more rounded everywhere.

Almost all laptops don't work right.  Some involve more adventures
than others.

The UX305C is working fine for us except for the "airplane mode" light
being constantly on.

Probably the function key functions don't work -- we haven't tried.

Most of the adventures for the UX305C seem to involve the Skylake
processor.  Skylake is the future of Intel processors (for a couple of
years) so we'll all have to get used to it.

| Well, I'm looking at ThinkPad T450 at CanadaComputers for $800.

That looks to be a good choice (but I haven't looked carefully).

- the trackpoint mouse buttons look to be reasonable after the Tx30
  generation screw-up.

- an i5-4300u is fine (a couple of generations back from Skylake, but
  with reasonable power consumption compared with the generation before)

- no optical drive and two batteries so this is a chassis with which I
  have no experience.  Is the second battery where an optical drive
  would go?

- I hope that it is easy to upgrade the HDD and RAM.
  Does it have a slot for mSATA SSD? (like T530 etc.)
  SSD makes a big performance difference.

- I really don't like 1366x768 displays

- The GPU is Intel's HD 4400.  Newer generations are more powerful.  Many
  T-series notebooks have nVidia GPUs added (at some expense in battery
  life).  For me the Intel GPU would be fine but some folks want more.

The Microsoft store!
<http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msca/en_CA/pdp/productID.332497100>

I don't know if it is available in their bricks and mortar stores, but it 
is available online with free delivery (and free returns).

$47.00 Canadian (less than US$35, the nominal and never discounted
price from authorized distributors in the US)!

Comes with an 8GB Micro SD card containing Windows 10 IoT.
(Consider this a free bonus, with a defect that is easily remedied.)

The page spends more ink on Linux than Windows.

They don't seem to offer cases, power supplies, or other accessories.

The picture shows a thing that is the size and shape of an SD card
with as raspi logo (as well as a MicroSD card).  But the Raspberry Pi
2 can't use an SD card.  Perhaps it is a superfluous MicroSD to SD converter.

(Older Raspberry Pi versions use an SD card, but I don't think that
they can use Win 10 IoT.)

Creatron have the Rasp Pi and the necessary accessories. They have two
stores in Toronto. I thought the price was pretty reasonable, but don't
remember the exact amounts.

What, getting specific old PiXMA drivers going? Forget it: even Canon
barely support existing printers on Windows and OS X. Their internals
are weird and proprietary.

I was pleasantly surprised over the holidays to be able to join two home
networks of relatives, and have their wireless printers be
auto-discovered and "just work" with Linux. Epson and HP deserve some
respect for this.

cheers,
 Stewart

That was an example from the WINE project, I'm using something different.

Modern printer support in Linux is nice. I would like to be able to 
print directly on printable CD's and DVD's, in Linux.

I suppose I could still do lightscribe,
www.lightscribe.com is no longer operational, but I have the lightscribe 
software for Linux in my collection.

I used to do printer support.

Something I (re)discovered recently...

Windows is unavoidable at work.  So, you're working on Windows machine, but you need your favourite Unix tools and utilities to process some file.  What do you do?  So far, I found 3 solutions:

1. VirtualBox -- virtualbox.org

Keep VirtualBox running minimized, with shared folder enabled.  Then, bring it up whenever you need it.  This is what I usually do, because VirtualBox is needed for other things.  But, this only works on your desktop.  If you have to move around to many machines, then this may not be ideal, because even though you can put VMs on USB stick, you need to install VirtualBox on those machines. 

2. BusyBox (for Windows) -- frippery.org/busybox/

It's single binary, and it's ideal for USB stick.  You get all the programs that BusyBox comes with.  But, sometimes, you need a full set of options that you're familiar with.


3. Cygwin -- cygwin.com


It's single directory which you can put on USB stick.  That directory becomes your root filesystem, but you can access other drives through /cygdrive which acts like /mnt.  This is my recent (re)discovery.  I knew about it, but totally forgot.

Windows 10 seems to auto discover the epson networked printers too
these days.  About time.  Cups has allowed this for years.

I thought a number of gnu tools were available compiled with mingw.
That could be an option too.  Unlike busybox they are the real full
tools, and unlike cygwin and virtualbox, you can actually use them in
your normal environment.

I believe as of 4.2 or 4.3 kernel, they should be OK.  I did an install
on a Core i7-6700k a couple of weeks ago, and had no issues.

No the Tx30 was fine, the Tx40 was the problem.  The Tx50 fixes it
(and the W541, since the W550 isn't out yet, but people wanted a fix
for the screw up).

Actually I believe there is a 3 cell battery internally (permanent)
and then an external swappable battery.  Now maybe that internal batter is
in fact where they used to have the optical drive (which I just noticed
does in fact appear to have gone away).

mSATA is obsolete.  M.2 it might have.  As far as I can tell it has an M.2
2242 slot (so 42mm max length) which is limiting, since most cards are 2280
(80 mm length).  It appears to be SATA only, so no NVMe or PCIe cards.

I thought the minimum was 1920x1080 on the T450, but I didn't check.

Only the Txx0p models I believe.

Under Windows 7 I successfully used rsync running under cygwin.

After upgrading(?!) to Windows 10, rsync will freeze and I can only 
close the cygwin session.

I have some time this weekend to find a solution. I did a Google and 
found this problem mentioned some time ago, but I never found a fix.

Can anyone help, or suggest another solution?

Duplicati has a Windows client too. Increamental, encrypted backups, works with
SSH or a bunch of different storage backends.

I know nothing about Windows 10 though.

I just have a cheap VPS (not Cloud at Cost because they are the worst)
on Digital Ocean and Putty (for command line access) and VNC/xrdp
(some virus scanners block VNC Viewer from running) with a BitLocker
image where I store my SSH keys

Way back in the mists of time we had a posix on dos(Unix had naming issues).

There is also VMware.

There have also been a number of providers of Unix command line tools 
natively compiled on windows.

I believe that rdiff-backup will also work on windows.
But it is currently limited to python2.x and there are some questions 
about ongoing maintenance.

I agree.  I currently have a ThinkPad E520 and previously had an R33. 
Both work well with Linux.  In fact, my first Linux experience was on a
ThinkPad, back when I was with IBM.  It was Mandrake, IIRC.  The only
issue I had was getting the token ring PCMCIA card to work.  I had to
change one line in a file and then it was fine.

How about msys2? I haven't tried it yet, but it seems promising.
It's a cygwin fork that uses the Arch Linux package manager.

Well, at least you have the important channels.  ;-)

I haven't watched analog in years.

I like the fish tank, but switching to encrypted digital instead of 
plain digital is just a scheme to make me retire my MythTV in favor of 
their tied PVR offering.

I think it's a money maker for them...  If I want to get any HD
channels I have to pay an extra $7/month for their HD box otherwise
you get a box that only does SD.  If they didn't encrypt then you
could just plug the cable directly into your TV and get all the HD
channels (though the on-demand wouldn't work).  I find it silly that I
pay for down-sampled SD channels that come for free OTA in 1080p but I
can pay extra to get the full version.

Another funny thing, the on-demand content isn't encrypted.  You can
find what other people are watching on-demand with the digital tuner
in your TV.  The only issue you're at the mercy of them pausing,
rewinding, or stopping whatever they're watching.

I was under the impression that the new encoding schemes that Rogers is 
using is not all that great.

I moved to an Antenna and OTT for my viewing needs something like 10 
years ago so other than seeing the lack of quality my in-laws are 
getting I can't attest to the quality of Rogers.

I don't off hand remember what the Bell compression was but I believe 
that it was better than Rogers.

I was involved with a couple of startup OTT TV services a few years back 
and I was never all that happy about the trade off between bandwidth and 
quality.
The standard broadcast TV stream at 1080i sucks back 20Mbits of network 
bandwidth.


Given that Toronto is a good location for picking up free to air signals 
I wonder if there is a way to share antenna space and transcode them 
down to something reasonable.
Set is up as a co-op and have members pick up the video streams as they 
desire.

I am sure we are not that important to rogers.

On the other hand freeing up bandwidth from the analog channels for more
channels and more cable modem bandwidth is useful to rogers.

Now if they can get more people to buy their pvr to replace a VCR,
I am sure rogers doesn't mind that.

I suspect for most people of course, spending $500 on the rogers pvr that
has 8 tuners and 1TB storage, or spending $300 on the HD box + $300 on
the HDPVR to get one tuner to work with your mythtv box, well I just
think most people go with the rogers box option.  Not me, but most people.
I don't think mythtv users were ever much of a concern to rogers.

Not sure what they use.  Bell uses MPEG4 for HD channels, but I think SD
channels are still MPEG2 on satelite.  Fibe would be MPEG4.  Rogers still
uses MPEG2 (pretty heavily compressed) for digital cable (which I guess
is pretty much all cable they do now).

Well apparently 256-QAM can do about 38Mbps in 6Mhz, which is better than
ATSC does, so cable companies can put more subchannels into one 6MHz band
than ATSC can, and by compressing extra over what the broadcaster did,
they can make room for even more channels.  It seems ATSC 3.0 some day
in the future would be able to have similar bandwidth to 256-QAM, and
would also switch from MPEG2 to H.265, saving more bandwidth, making
room for 4k broadcasts.  Would of course be incompatible with all
existing tuners.

I bought 2 of my boxes outright and my PVR will be mine for $1 next
August.  I am not paying rental.  My account is charged and then
refunded the rental amount each month.  I also bought my previous PVR,
again with no rental.

I could be wrong, but I believe the newer PVRs support MPEG4.  Also,
we'll have to see what happens when IPTV arrives.

They do, but the old ones (of which there are a lot of users) do not.

Breaking the 4200/4250 and 8300 would not go over well.

There are a couple of ways of handling this.  IPTV can be MPEG4
exclusively, since the older boxes can't handle it anyway.  Also, with
switched video, you can get the stream your PVR can use or, with all the
extra bandwidth freed up from analog, just have both versions on the
cable.  This sort of thing is already happening, where you can get both
HD and SD on the same channel number.

old school...
http://www.cisco.com/web/consumer/support/settop_8300hddvr.html

The fun part of supporting this market (U.S.A.) was when a tech-savvy 
customer would call in and want to know how to hook up an optional hard 
drive for the DVR boxes...

Even more interesting was supporting the higher-end DVR technology from 
Cisco...

Everything from install considerations to troubleshooting bizarre issues

MobaXterm is primarily a remote access tool but provides some Cygwin
functionality (and an X Server) <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>

I still haven't gotten around to actually trying Qubes OS - a
"reasonably secure" OS that combines linux & windows virtual machines
- so I'm uncertain if it might apply in this context.  That said,
there was a mailing list thread recently discussing a live USB
prototype that may be interesting to evaluate.

Greetings

Laptop my wife has been using a her computer is starting to have
occasional graphics issues. Its an all in one mobo but its also almost
7 years old so looked for a replacement.

BestBuy had some systems on sale for after Christmas so ordered an Asus desktop.

AMD mobo 6 GB of ram, built in wifi w DVD RW all for can $360 inc shipping.

Now comes the kicker. Wanted to set the uefi bios to boot from Cd-rom
so that I could use gparted to give myself some disc room to enable a
dual boot system (Debian testing being the flavor du jour). It will
NOT boot onto the cd-rom it says that an illegal modification has been
made to the bios and the next boot option must be chosen.

(There was zero material with this system. It boots and all but there
is nothing with it. Even the OS key is burned into the bios. There
isn't even a system sticker any more!!)

Any suggestions on how to get this system to boot onto the cd-rom
short of pulling the hard drive and replacing it?

TIA

Dee

That was the clue that I needed. Secure boot was still enabled. With that
removed I was able to use gparted to reduce the large partition to something
that leaves room for what I want.

I have been mucking about with a server uefi bios and I thought that that
was imbecilic but this one here made the server one seem straight forward
and that's scary.

No wonder most people won't touch their computers - - - the bloatware
malware and useless obsfucation isn't just rampant there isn't anything
else left!

Subject: [GTALUG] Is there an "ubuntu" package for xterm-toolbar?
Message-ID: <569194FF.12644.14805A@sciguy.vex.net>

I was wondering if anyone on this list uses xterm with a toolbar? Toolbars are 
the thingies which would normally work on CTRL+mousebutton, except that they 
are permanently fixed on to the top of the window below the title bar. 

I can get a toolbar by default on Cygwin/X, but not in Ubuntu Studio 14.x. The 
Ubuntu manpage for xterm says that +tb is the option to use, but all I get from 
that is a error message. Supported and documented under xterm, but not in the 
actual Ubuntu binary ... ?

Do I need to download a different package which has the toolbar option compiled 
in? Anyone know?

At the top of the section of the xterm man page that lists "+tb" and
"-tb" it says:

"Not all options are necessarily configured into your copy of xterm."

And when I try to run "xterm -tb" ("-" rather than "+" is apparently
wanted to turn the permanent toolbar on) it gives me the short help
message and suggests I use "xterm -help" to get the long help message.
When I do that, I find that many options are listed, but not "tb".
I'm using an older version of Ubuntu, so I'm probably in the same boat
as you: I don't think that option is available to us.  Many of these
are throw-backs to 30 years ago and no one bothers with them anymore?

I also tried a bunch of settings in the ~/.Xdefaults file (speaking of
throwbacks that no one uses ...):

XTerm*mainMenu*toolbar: on
XTerm*mainMenu*toolBar: on
XTerm*toolBar: on

These made no perceptible difference, although I'm not entirely sure
I'm using them correctly.

I'm not sure what you're looking for in your menu items, but there are
an immense number of terminals available that have menubars across the
top: eterm, gnome-terminal, gtk-term, kterm, lxterminal,
xfce4-terminal, even roxterm (at some point I've used most of these,
but I admit I mostly used images.google.com to determine if they had
menu bars).  There are probably dozens of less well known ones as
well: everybody thinks they know how a terminal should be written.

Generality these guys are using h264 encoding in an mpeg4 wrapper.
I was talking to a someone a year or two ago who was looking to use h265.

The currently CRTC licensed and active  providers that I know of are 
Zazeen and VMedia.
There is also a company called ATOP(atoptv.com) that has a CRTC license 
but do not have any venture capital funding like the other two guys.

A quick look around shows up some guys called wowtv that seems to have a 
service but I am sure its not CRTC licensed.

and there is 
https://www.teliphone.com/en/personal/internet-hd-tv-ip-tv-services.html 
whose service was running out of Montreal when I looked at them a few 
years ago but I have a feeling they are not CRTC compliant but that is 
just my feeling.

In Canada all the "TV" content is regulated which  means that any IPTV 
provider has access to all the content sources that the big boys use.
The downside is that most of the content is owned or licensed through 
Rogers or Bell and these guys are making it hard for small providers to 
get a foothold.
One example is that one of the sports channel providers(names are not 
being used to protect the guilty) insisted that if you took the SD feed 
you had to take the HD feed per subscribed customer. This meant that you 
had to charge your customer for both feeds or eat the cost.

It's about a 10 minute walk (800 meters to the north) from the meeting

Just curious...

I noticed that distros tend to create user account with unique UID and
unique GID (and usually both are the same id).  For example, UID=1000
and GID=1000.

What is the reason behind it?

As I understand it, it's so you can give some, but not all, other users
group access to your stuff.  With a common GID, it's everyone or no one.

GID does not have to equal UID.
It just does by convention.
If you can keep the relationship then it makes admin a slight bit easier.

For example if you do an ls  and get

   4 drwxrwxr-x.  2  108 108    4096 Feb 23  2015 foo.bar

you know the owner/group are set to a reasonable value as opposed to

   4 drwxr-xr-x.  7 1000 500    4096 Dec 14  2012  bar.baz

where you now need to lookup the GID for UID 1000.

Certainly, and my understanding is that the IPTV will be mpeg4.

Well as for HD and SD on the same channel, that I believe is actually
a trick in the cable box, where the HD boxes are told to tune the HD
equivalant stream if you select the SD channel number.  Both streams exist
(well maybe, the switching could mean they don't at any given time)
and the box just has to tune the right stream.

There isn't one.

But most distributions use uid/gid 1000+ as regular users, and if you
always create a user and their matching group (as the adduser and such
tools do by default), then the assigned numbers will always stay in sync
since they are allocated at the same rate.

So it is pretty much just a coincidence.

Servers don't ship with secureboot enabled.  Windows 8 and 10 machines
are required to by Microsoft if they want to have the sticker with the

Skylake CPUs can hang during certain computations.  Prime searching folks 
found this.

Interesting that Intel says that new firmware can fix it.

(The article reminds us that Haswell CPUs had a but in the TSX feature and 
that the firmware fix just removed TSX.  I felt robbed because one reason 
I bought a system with that processor was that I wanted to play with 
TSX.))

# A Journeyman's Tour of Vim with Giles Orr

We won't be covering i-a-h-j-k-l:wq, but instead looking at a variety
of commands and plugins you may not be familiar with that can make
your editor even better.  This will include a discussion of neovim,
colours, dealing with your vimrc, mappings, buffers and tabs,
sessions, plugins, VimScript, and possibly a couple other topics.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

Thanks, Myles, for suggesting a dinner spot.  I intend to join you.

I don't expect this to be "before each meeting".

OSM doesn't to know this place but it seems to be just north of
Pizzaiolo, a block and a half south of Wellesley St.

Firmware updates have been available for all intel CPUs since the
Pentium Pro.  I think they learned the hard way on the Pentium which
did not have that feature and needed it.

At least by turning it off on the broken ones, it means software can
safely use it on the new ones where it is fixed.  Better than having to
declare the feature permanently broken.

Many years ago, I worked as a computer tech, maintaining various models
of minicomputer.  One thing some computers had then was accessable
microcode.  With the Data General Eclipse line, the microcode was stored
in ROM, but if the Writable Control Store (WCS) option was installed,
you could add new or even modify existing instructions.  The DEC VAX
11/780 loaded it's microcode from a floppy at every boot, so it was a
simple matter to provide an updated version.

It was "fun" trouble shooting a problem by stepping through the
microcode.  ;-)

At least you could do that if you had to in order to track down a problem.

The alpha couldn't do memory management without extra instructions loaded
at boot (usually by the firmware, although milo could fake it).
Those instructions were written in a special low level instruction
language for the alpha which had access to internal registers for the
MMU and TLB that normal instructions couldn't touch, and created
instructions software could execute.

So Digital kept that idea going.

Totally disagree with Steve on this one.

It was about 1000$ from what I remember, and cheaper​ ​for
a workstation, and cheaper in bulk buys
(digiboard drivers wo

well on it, over linux at the time as well).

In tech support, a few times I called up, I actually talked to to the likes

​, etc, so it was a
small shop at the time, and prices would have dropped if sales were very
high volume.​
​ (i was cust ~#2000 ish)
If Linux didn't come along, BSDI and other player would have had to drop
prices, and if Linux didn't come in, another would have, i.e. RMS and herd
, etc.
​ Who is to say in a few years even BSDi could have done "free",
with a nice gig for paid support, etc.​
So at best Linux bought us a year (Still a great thing that is!), but not
anything like the what the article says. If Linux never saw the light of

I have to admit I am not quite sure if I agree with you completely.

The problem that the early BSD variants faced was AT&T licensing.
If there was only BSD around it may have stayed closed for a long time 
even to today.

What Linux brought to the table was a platform that was Unix like but 
did not depend on any previous encumbered code.

Eventually linux developed enough of a following that the value for 
AT&T,SCO,Microsoft et al had no real value in trying to hold on to the 
rights.

The trouble is that Linux is the culmination of lots of other peoples work.
If RMS had not written GCC and the various Unix command line tools I 
doubt if Linux would exist as it does today.
If tens of thousands of developers had not gifted application software 
to the project then Linux would be a nice little university students 
project and just about as popular as Minix.

It would be much better to label that commercial as the world without FOSS.

So yes the url posted could never be held up as an example of "truth in 
advertising".
But on the other hand I don't think that there is any living example of 
"truth in advertising".

these websites degenerate into a weird alphabet soup.  There is a very interesting 
point here, near and dear to the Free Software community...

I don't think that's a reasonable interpreation of the history.  BSDI and
AT&T settled in 1994, at which point I think it was fair to say that
proprietary UNIX still had significant value.  (Sun machines with Solaris
were a huge part of the internet insfrastructure until the early 2000's -
or later.)

My personal opinion is that if linux didn't exist, FreeBSD would likely be
dominant, and that things would be very similar to what we currently have.

If I remember correctly BSDI was selling their variant until long after 
linux caught on.
Remember the first distributions showed up in 1992 and we were building 
some small in house systems based on SLS and Yggdrasil at Siemens around 
that time.

I could never prove it but my belief is that BSDI would have continued 
to sell their Unix if it were not for Linux.
Bill Jolitz may have taken a run at a free system with his bsd variant 
but its not clear what would have happened with the various law suits 
floating around at that time.when we did some business with him a few 
years before he was very sensitive to the AT&T lawyers and was careful 
to insure source code did not leak out.

I doubt that an established company would have brought out a free 
operating system just because the conventional wisdom was and still is 
that you need to protect your intellectual property and giving it away 
is madness.

Almost all the original free software came from individuals or very 
small groups.
I would bet that if Linus Torvalds knew how big linux were to become he 
would have licensed it some how.

Subject: [GTALUG] Music Broadcast Server?
Message-ID: <56966BC4.3020400@rogers.com>

I currently use Mediatomb as a server and have Panasonic UPnP players. 
They are mainly Bluray players but do more, including play .flac files.

But they each connect separately and play their own streams independently.

What I would like to do is have each unit play the same music stream. It 
would be like having multiple radios in my home set to the same station.

Is there a Linux solution for this?

Cheers

I recently came across this:

    https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync

    AirPlay audio player. Shairport Sync adds multi-room capability with Audio Synchronisation 

which seemed interesting.

And also made a note of this on multi-room audio with Raspberry Pi:

Hope that helps - cheers!

I have used runeaudio on rasberry pi.
It has a nice web interface and is reasonably easy to use.
But it is a bit quirky and I have found it to crash from time to time.

I was looking at trying to get something like multicast running where 
any player could multicast what its playing and the other players could 
subscribe.

At least Linux and GNU showing up spared us from putting up with the
horrors that are BSD user space and packaging (if you can even call
it that).

But certainly the internet could exist without linux, and it did before.

Certainly in the mid to late 90s there used to be a system for linux to
allow executing BSDi binaries.  These days it would be much more likely
for people to want BSD to be able to execute linux binaries.  But back
then commercial software was compiled for BSDi, not linux.

I don't know if he would have.  He obviously (as per the original
announcement) didn't think it would ever be anything other than a fun toy.

I would say that depends on what you define as "original".

Many would consider the original BSD code as free, and that came
from the University of California.

Going back to the mid-80's there was lots of free software,
much of it from large organizations or companies.  Perhaps not
officially, but it was there.

We tried to buy BSD source for a project.

The first task that was required was to get a V7 licence from AT&T.

So BSD was only free to those who owned a Unix license already.

There were more systems than that, so I'm by no means certain that
it would have been FreeBSD that would have dominated, though I'd
keep it pretty high on the list.

I remember using MiNT (which was Atari ST-specific, standing for
MiNT is Not TOS), which was a POSIX-y environment back then.

MINIX is what Linus Torvalds was most directly reacting to; had
Linux not emerged, people would have doubtless found MINIX more
interesting to hack on for longer.

BeOS was a later emerged development, but nevertheless, still
another of the UNIX-like systems that emerged in profusion.

I wouldn't have been shocked to see Mortice Kern Systems
have something emerge looking rather like a UNIX, based on
the MKS toolkit (which was once popular on MS-DOS).

Entertaining to quote from the Tanembaum/Torvalds feud:

"Of course 5  years from now that will be different,  but 5 years from
now  everyone  will  be  running  free  GNU on  their  200  MIPS,  64M
SPARCstation-5."  -- Andrew Tanenbaum, 1992.

(Where "free GNU" is presumably a reference to GNU Hurd.)

Some will remember QNX (which never was free, but it's
local-ish, and interesting), fewer will remember VSTa.
Mark Williams Company Coherent was a commercial Unix
clone that was pretty clearly pushed out of the market by Linux.
SCO used to be a big deal, back in the days when they
produced decent systems, rather than playing legal games.

My point isn't that any of these would individually have been
"most likely" as alternatives to Linux; the point is that there
really were a lot of would-be alternatives out there, and lots of
people working on different fragments of the "alternative Unix"
problem.

I find it highly believable that efforts would have coalesced
*somewhere* had the lawsuits relating to BSD kept up and
Linux not been around.

I added a section on "Programmer Fonts" and using TTF fonts in XTerm
since so many people preferred terminals over the GUI version of the
editor.  I realize that most people use more "advanced" terminal
emulators, but for the old school among you ...

Neat - but the Powerline project doesn't explain why they need to patch
the fonts in the first place. Font design is much harder than it looks,
and exceptional care and skill is required.

I think that what they're doing is adding some characters that are
used to display special symbols (ie. for git upstream, or a pretty
arrow) on the Vim status bar.  Don't think they touch the existing
font at all.  I have no idea if that addresses your concerns or makes
them worse: I know nothing about font design.

I am mostly an Emacs user, and have quite a lot of stuff in
$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el

I use a system for managing Emacs setup called el-get, by a fellow I often
conference
with called Dimitri Fontaine.  (He also does Postgres and Lisp!)

I have a ~/.vim directory, which has nothing in it.

The vim config file I didn't realize was there and had interesting contents
was $HOME/.viminfo,
which seems to have some fascinating history about what things I have
edited using vim over
the last several years.  If you use vim a lot, I'll bet you'll find neat
stuff in .viminfo!

Wow, that is a long list of stuff in that file. Mine hardly has anything by 
comparison. I use the following to automatically fix whitespace and 
de-tabify when editing various source code files.

:autocmd BufEnter *.c,*.h,*.cpp,*.php,*.cs set comments=sl:/*,mb:**,elx:*
:autocmd BufEnter *.c,*.h,*.cpp,*.php,*.cs,*.py set sts=4 expandtab ts=4 sw=4

BeOS was very NOT unix.  The thing was so anti multiuser it made Microsoft
look like they understood multiuser machines.  It was multimedia
performance above all else.  User accounts and security was totally
irrelevant to BeOS.

Part of QNX was temporarily open source.  Then they changed their minds.
It too is certainly not very unixy.

I think sharing a whole vimrc is a bit much to digest but these are a couple
settings I enjoy:

" case insensitive search
set ignorecase
" exact matching if pattern contains an Upper case char
set smartcase

" hilite search results
set hlsearch
highlight Search ctermfg=black ctermbg=yellow

" Don't like people determining how my editor behaves
set nomodeline

I've noticed over the years that it's mostly been the programmers who
are able to do most if not all their work on one system who are able
to customize it to the Nth degree.  This was even more so back in the
day when an attempt to compile GNU Emacs was something people launched
over a weekend.

Sysadmins and support people usually didn't get the luxury of staying
inside their own personalized environment.

Ed and vi were what you got on a Unix system in the SysV era; the latter
was usually easier to use.  Emacs wasn't an easy choice to make until
the Linux binary-package era and by then I was too used to vi.

(FWIW, I'd first met Emacs on a PR1ME system several years before I met
vi, but it was a demo copy we couldn't afford to buy.)

I've mostly been doing work that involved logging into a default
environment on larger pools of machines over the years (starting back
when the better modems were 2400 baud!) and being able to get work done
without tweaking the environment first was more of a priority.  Dealing
with quirks like having to set TERM first, or someone else had picked C
Shell or EDITOR=jove as overridden defaults, or Sun putting /opt/wtf/bbq
in PATH ahead of saner versions of random tools, or RedHat aliasing
common commands to their --with-training-wheels versions, well, after
awhile you learn what not to step in.

That probably went on a bit long, but the point I was getting at was not
forgetting how to drive a default environment.

Or someone doing forensics on you can glean interesting data from that
file.  Having said that, maybe .bash_history is another file you should
glance into...

So the what3words address would be rightfully.probes.belly :-)

However, your pointer seems to be pointing to room 1B18 but the room
given in Colin's message is 1E05.

Oh man! That's what I get for relying on technology.  So, directly from
the Conestoga College map, here's the campus layout:

I'm not really sure. I've wondered about the number of emails I'm getting 
that have an A with the inverted V like accent mark over top of it. I see 
those odd characters all over a lot messages.

I can only think it is due to some bad or misconfigured email program, or it 
could be someone sending an email in other than standard ASCII text  format 
(but not in full HTML style).

For several reasons I always keep Thunderbird configured to treat all email 
messages as containing standard text and not as (possible) HTML.

Kevin.

Well, if that number is hex, then there's only a max of 65636 rooms.  ;-)

I would have a deep look at the headers of the messages.  I bet that there

this header:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"; Format="flowed"

Lots of mail is still encoded in other charsets.  For example Windows-12* 
(* means some digits that I don't remember).  Confusion can lead to lots

You could look at the raw message but that has a bit of a learning curve.

Indeed; a hexdump (of a fragment saved using vi) shows them to be LF's (0A).  Is this the entire story, do you think?  Or is vi already giving me a sanitized version, and that's what I am saving?  It's not clear to me what to use to extract the "real" contents of the message; and finding my way through a hexdump of my entire very large mailfile doesn't seem feasible.  Do you have any thoughts on this?

I wouldn't be so interested if it was just one message.  But this has been happening a lot lately (and not in the past).  I do have to wonder what in the world could be causing it...

Going from 2 year old recall here.

When I was working for an ISP we did deploy these for some of our customers. I was using one myself for most of a year. At one point near the end I had signal quality issue that a 2wire modem powered through. Very shortly after that I switch to VDSL2.

Linux wise they were just fine.

Last I knew the Toronto Free Net was deploying these for the majority of customers which were not already bringing their own modems.

In 2009 I evaluated three TP-Link modems:

8610
8616
8841

The 8610 doesn't even have telnet access.
The 8616 is ok under good conditions, but is useless for diagnosing or addressing problems.

The 8841 is much better, if you want to know what's going on.
If you are interested, the 8841 runs a rudimentary GNU/Linux, accessible via telnet, so you can (automatically) monitor and analyze your ADSL line condition.

If you are connected to a CO via long wire (rather than to a nearby Remote), this may be important.

This is a very basic DSL modem, I've used it with a Raspberry Pi router 
running OpenWRT with no problems whatsover.

I have a PHD-VRX2 Linux-based PVR that is misbehaving and I've replaced it
with a ChannelMaster unit, so the PHD is being scrapped.

It boots up (the display says 'boot') and then after a few seconds, it
reboots itself again.

If you're handy, you might want to have a go at fixing it. Or check with
the company if they can fix it for a reasonable price. Or reprogram it
with Myth TV ;).

Anyone want to take this away?

Since I like to hack away at older equipment and keep it workable I had a
look at the website. There was a firmware update in August 2014, perhaps
this is what is needed here.

How would you compare the two?

I presume that neither let you hack the firmware.

The PHD-VRX2 page looks a bit unmaintained.  For example, it mentions
Zap2it which got renamed some time ago.

The PHD-VRX2 documentention mentions MPEG2 while DVR+ documentation
mentions MPEG4.

I got notice of a sale on DVR+ (I'm on their mailing list because I bought 
a few distribution amplifiers from them).  CMVIP code at checkout gets $50 
off.  All prices are, of course, US$.  I'm not even sure how good they are 
at shipping to Canada.

Thanks for offering your PHD-VRX2 to the list!

Just had one those 'that's really cool' moments.

I have my Phone paired with my desktop system. I also tend to use 
Amarok, KDE's native music player, to stream internet radio. I just took 
a phone call, and with out realizing, KDEConnect had stopped the stream. 
I only noticed this once it automatically started it back up again after 
the call.

I'm living in the future.

Russell -

I did that software upgrade and it seemed to be successful at the time, so
I think it's some other problem.

Yeah, I know what you mean. I love KDE Connect. I am waiting for them to
release the support to answer sms/calls.

But, still, it's already nice to receive the notifications, since sometimes
my phone is in another room and I can't hear when someone calls me or send
me a SMS.

The ChannelMaster unit is physically much smaller - amazingly thin. And it
has a much better user interface. Operating it is much simpler than the
PHD-VRX2.

> I presume that neither let you hack the firmware.

No. But the PHD-VRX2 is fairly obviously Linux based, so if you can figure
out a way into the machine, you might be able to do that.

I get the impression it does run linux (although maybe it doesn't).
I sure can't find anywhere that they offer GPL sources for the GPL bits
it likely contains.  Why am I not surprised.

Well could e interesting to poke at it a bit to see.  It probably has

Well I see alsa, linux kernel, busybox, uClibc, a lot of directFB stuff,
some broadcom wifi proprietary kernel modules, ntfs-3g, etc.

Tons of GPL stuff and some ugly broacdom stuff.

Subject: [GTALUG] Headless laptop - controlling X settings
Message-ID: <CAEnxSC7CBOefcmBb9PkbnwjRc4BK_-U4sqF+nFj0B=dHQDE6HQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have an old laptop (an Acer Travelmate 270 to be exact) that has no
screen.  The screen busted years ago, and I simply removed it.  This
wasn't a big problem until a couple days ago: I'd hook it up to an
external screen via the VGA out, and everything was fine.  But a
couple days ago, I upgraded from Debian wheezy to Debian jessie, and
after the upgrade the external monitor now claims the provided signal
is "Out of Range."  This doesn't appear to be the same as "No signal"
because after several minutes it switches off (about when the screen
blanking would kick in) and pressing a keyboard button brings back the
"Out of Range" signal.  I can ssh into the machine, so there's an
option to fix it.  I could potentially install Ubuntu or re-install
wheezy, but I'd prefer to fix this if possible.  How do I tell X to
detect and use the monitor over the external VGA connector - and only
that connector, ignoring the now-missing internal screen candidate?
And failing that, how can I force 1024x768 (which is what was working
fine with wheezy) with mirroring across both outputs?

Thanks.

P.S. I was clever enough to try ssh with X-forwarding and then running
arandr and eventually xrandr, but they work with the X server they can
talk to ... which is your local machine, not the remote you've sshed
into.  Even had that worked, I wouldn't know what settings to put into
what file: it was bad enough back in the days of editing
/etc/X11/Xorg.conf by hand, but it's now been replaced by a twisty
maze of start-up scripts that are supposed to detect everything for
you that mostly work but which have remained stubbornly opaque to me
when they fail ...

1. Check BIOS to set monitor priority.
2. Try booting into console mode by 
    - runlevel 1 at kernel boot option
    - alt-ctrl-fn to get VTn

I assume you already did 1 and 2.

3. SSH into it and 'telinit 1'.  Don't know if it still works with
systemd.
4. Try Ubuntu. :-)

See if you can get it to boot to console mode:

Pointing the environment XAUTHORITY and DISPLAY at the local machine
should allow you to run xrandr remotely.

DISPLAY=:0.0 and XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority or maybe something in /tmp
depending on the displaymanager tends to work.

If X is indeed running on the affected monitor, and you can get remote
authority to write to the X server driving your VGA port, you might be able
to control the output using "xrandr". It might also be possible to specify
an xrandr command line for the display manager's benefit.

X.org configuration has gone largely automatic, but it should still be
possible to constrain the monitor settings without going full-tilt into
CRTC timings...

Certainly the /var/log/Xorg.0.log or whatever it is called these days
might be useful to look at to see why it might be giving bad timing.
