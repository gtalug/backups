Thanks!  You present several good choices.

I see that this time we are only allowed to vote for one.
Last time we were allowed to tick more than one.

I'd prefer to see a way of providing more information.  I'm not sure
what it would look like.  Ranking?  Fractional votes?


More details of the choices:

Restaurant Formerly Known As Love at First Bite (Pizza)
	We know this one.  Not bad at all.

Kaiju (Japanese Curry)
	- we went there once before.  Service a bit overwhelmed
	  but very polite and accomodating.

	- one of several restaurants in the food court.
	  + allows alternate choices while eating together
	  + but most are closed at our time

Hokkaido Ramen Santouka
	Japanese noodle soup chain.
	<http://www.santouka.co.jp/en/menu/index.html>	
	<http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hokkaido-ramen-santouka-toronto-2>

Lou Dawg's (BBQ)
	We've been there once (some of us more, I think).
	<http://loudawgs.com/home.html>

The Senator (Diner)
	<http://thesenator.com/>
	Apparently the New York Times reviewed it!
	By the prices, I'd call this a faux diner.
	The cheapest entree (today?) is
	"8 oz Cumbrae’s Naturally Raised Beef Burger - $16"
	(Cumbrae is a very well thought of local butcher)

OPA! of Greece Dundas Street (Greek)
	<http://www.opasouvlaki.ca/home>
	A national chain / franchise.  May well be good.

Banh Mi Boys (Vietnamese)
	<http://www.banhmiboys.com/menu.htm>

	I remember discovering Banh Mi on Spadina, near Dundas.
	Amazing sandwiches for $1 or $1.25.  Well they've gone up
	there to perhaps $2 (I haven't looked since TLUG and Hacklab
	deserted the area.

	These guys do an upmarket version.  Surely worth the money.
	But it makes me wistful for the good old days ("more
	authentic").

Hi Alex,

If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

I currently have T43, and its keyboard is difficult to type on, at least
for me.
    - it's stiff, so you need to "push" rather than "tap", 
    - it doesn't spring back, fast enough or "crispy" enough, so you
      actually notice and become aware of the keypresses.  And, that
      interferes with my typing.

Are you able to type fast and comfortably on your T420?

A long time ago (more than a decade) someone used XEmacs as the basis
of a window manager:

It's been pretty much abandoned for the last seven years.

This is more of a test of the LimeSurvey web application.

There is a way to do ranking questions[1] in LimeSurvey so we can try
that next month.

The nearest to "in practice" that has arrived is the series of tiling
window managers
that have UIs loosely similar to GNU Screen.

I'm thinking of ratpoison, stumpwm, dwm, and such.  The model they take
is that windows correspond (more or less) to Emacs buffers, and one's
attachment of a set of buffers to the display (e.g. - which buffers you've
got visible) correspond to a "workspace" concept.

You set up key bindings to let you adjust window ("buffer") visibility on
screen,
and key bindings to let you switch workspaces (which would lead to
displaying
a different set of buffers/windows).

I'm usually using stumpwm these days, almost always with just one workspace,
so that I see one window at a time, switching when I want to head to another
window ("buffer").

That seems to be where control of this has gone.  There may have been some
code around to enable having Emacs talk directly to stumpwm, not obvious
where it is (and I notice that the repo has moved from Savannah to GitHub,
which probably means I need to "rebase" my use of it; I've apparently been
tracking a dead-ish branch).  Direct Emacs integration has gotten pretty
secondary, it seems.

I think I'd be way more inclined to use stumpwm, and have some Emacs
hooks to talk to it (which isn't hard to have) than to talk directly to X
from
Emacs.

I have a new  T440p with 16GB, running Fedora 22, thus far it's reasonable.
I'm a hunt-and-peck person, so the KB isn't a big consideration: it 
works, I'm happy.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now.  But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs.  Fewer cores and
  lower clock rates, for a start.  There are exceptions but they are
  outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs.  But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
  do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained.  May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
  (but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
  fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware.  Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take 
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts 
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful 
and expandable (may depend on the generation).  My son's W520 will accept 
up to 32G of RAM, I think.  Lennart has a similar one.  And it comes with 
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older

"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is 
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,
many seem fine / good enough.  None has captured me.

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue).  It is fine, but not
a revelation.  I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches.  I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Considering amount of typing I do, keyboard is very important for me.  I
use Topre Realforce keyboard (capacitive key).  It's the most expensive
keyboard, but my wrists would not have lasted this long without it.

I can accept the hassle of external keyboard with laptop... if the
laptop has 16GB.  On my Slackware machine, my ram usage is 8GB (out of
16GB total).  Firefox-31.8.0esr alone is using 4GB!  That leaves 8GB for
VMs.

I have a rather depressing variety of mechanical keyboards, including
a couple IBM Model Ms.  To clarify my biases, I LOVE the feel of the
IBM Model M keys.  My keyboard at work is a Kinesis Advantage with
their standard Cherry Brown switches.  I think the Advantage's
physical layout is about the best that's available in any keyboard
right now: vertical columns (rather than slanted columns we still
persist in copying from typewriters: not only is it no longer
necessary, it's actually ergonomically bad), dished hand areas to
match differences in finger length, and a split between the hands.

I have three Kinesis Advantages.  As mentioned, one has the original
Cherry Browns.  They're okay.  I have a second that I refitted with
Cherry Blues: that's the one I use at home.  That's my idea of a great
keyboard.  The Cherry Blues are about as close as you'll get to the
behaviour of the IBM Model M buckling spring keys (short of buying one
of the Unicomp keyboards that actually have buckling springs).  They
have a strong tactile click when the key activates.  It's also
audible: it's just as well I live alone, as the Blues are notoriously
loud and irritate the crap out of people nearby (just like the Model
M).  I refitted the third Kinesis Advantage with Cherry Clears.
Initially they feel quite similar to the Browns, but they're stiffer:
you don't notice it immediately, but after a couple hours of typing, I
found it genuinely tiring to use.  I don't use it much.

I highly recommend the Cherry Blues to non-gamers.  Just be prepared
for the noise.  The bigger Canada Computers stores usually have
several keyboards with different Cherry switches out for testing.

If anyone has questions about any of this, feel free to contact me
off-list: I've been a bit of a keyboard wonk for a couple decades.

FWIW I have been very happy with my Cooler Master CheeryBrown-based KB
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=21_273_274&item_id=061959

I brought it to work to replace the crap PC standard one that came with the
office PC. Quieter then Cherry Blue but still noisier than the squishy
standard, works just as good for me.

Based on the statuses (e.g. - autoRenewPeriod), nope, they didn't.
The registry did that automatically.  (There's standard policy about that.
See RFC 3915)

I wouldn't assume that all will necessarily "be well"; the DNS info is
pretty
clear about pointing it to a "parking zone".

The bit of being in autoRenewPeriod means things are a bit on "autopilot,"
and I'd kind of expect that the registrar is trying to pester the owner to
pay them.

If the folk managing the domain have forgotten about it, and email
addresses
have changed, and such, then perhaps the warnings of Deletion Coming
Soon will disappear into the aether.

If anyone knows anyone involved (e.g. - perhaps the Shawn Amundson
indicated in contact information in WHOIS), it's probably worth giving them
a poke soon-ish otherwise the domain may go away.  An email address
of form "something at gimp.org" won't work, for sure, right now.

| If T420 can do 16GB, then I can replace my desktop with it, which has
| 16GB (DDR3-1333) right now. But, I have question about T420 keyboard.

Most notebooks don't have the performance of desktops because the
tradeoffs are different.

- Most notebook CPUs are weaker than desktop CPUs. Fewer cores and
lower clock rates, for a start. There are exceptions but they are
outliers.

- Ditto for GPUs. But GPUs may not matter much for what you hope to
do.

- adding disks and RAM is more constrained. May well be OK anyway

- desktop displays can and should be better than notebook displays
(but I seem to care more than most folks)

- in a fixed installation, notebooks are a bit awkward (but you can
fix that by using an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse).

Many new notebooks don't let you replace batteries, RAM, or disks.
Beware. Of course this is not the case with ThinkPad T420 notebooks.

If you want portability, the T420 is too old: more modern Intel CPUs take
a lot less power for the same performance and thus the battery lasts
longer.

If you don't want portability, a W-series ThinkPad may be more powerful
and expandable (may depend on the generation). My son's W520 will accept
up to 32G of RAM, I think. Lennart has a similar one. And it comes with
a larger screen.

Here's an example of a very powerful non-portable notebook:

- quad core i7-4710hq
- 1920x1080 17" IPS screen
- 16G of RAM (that may well be the limit)
- NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX860M Graphics with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM
Beware: bilingual keyboard

Many people love ThinkPad keyboards, especially the ones on older
ThinkPads. One of the main complaints about newer ThinkPad keyboards is
"they aren't as good as the old ones".

How can this square with your observations?

- keyboards are at least partially a matter of personal taste

- your T43 might have a dud keyboard.

In any case, the only way you'll really know if you'll like a keyboard is
to try it.

Me? Lots of keyboards seem bad, some seem elegant but not to my taste,
many seem fine / good enough. None has captured me.

Many typists like being sure when they press a key.

Significant key travel is considered desirable by many (but not all).

A tactile signal of a keypress registering is considered a Good Thing
(except by many gamers). Something sort of lost with most modern
key structures.

There has been a renaissance of mechanical keyboards. They cost
several times as much as regular keyboards. And a great deal has been

Cherry blue, brown, or clear keys.
<http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/>

I'm using a mechanical keyboard to type this (Rosewill RK-6000;
imitation Alps keys, somewhat like Cherry Blue). It is fine, but not
a revelation. I have the same reaction to my wife's keyboard with
Cherry brown switches. I find it especially disappointing that a key
can register on my keyboard without a click and a click can happen
without a registration (these problems don't seem to happen with the
way I type).

In ThinkPads, I like my x61's keyboard better than my T530's.

Ouch.  This is an argument in favour of having different parts of services
in some different places, particularly email services.

Interesting tool I saw pointed at in the discussion; it offers the ability
to notify SEVERAL people of impending expiries of domains and SSL certs.
    http://www.expirify.com/about/
It of course has some clear "and why should I trust this with anything
important?" issues.

Hi William,

I used to have T42 a few years ago, and after years of abuse the
keyboard on that laptop starter to bend and rattle as I typed, that kind
of annoyed me but that was caused due to wear and tear, although your
keyboard has a different defect, I suspect it was caused by the same
reason. At this point your T43 is 10 years old.

Other than that I would consider thinkpad keyboars as good of a laptop
keyboard as it could ever be -- both for layout (function pgup/down keys
in a separate row) and key travel (it is pretty crisp).

Unlike other laptop keyboards, especially cramped netbook keyboards, I'm
able to type comfortably for extended periods of time without getting
any pain in my wrists, keys are big, far apart and I have sausage
fingers. Still it is not as good as separate keyboard, and a good
computer table/chair combo, as laptops by their design, inherently put
you in a suboptimal typing position, but it is as good as it possibly
gets for a laptop.

I tend to be pretty hard on keyboard so on average I tend to replace the
keyboard on my laptop every few years -- there are three variants. So
far I've used two types -- the only difference I've noticed is in the
design of butterfly mechanism supporting the keys. I've been been
completely contend with both.

https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-76711

Replacing a keyboard on a thinkpad is a really easy thing to do,
instructions for replacing most of the things on thinkpads are available
on lenovo website.

https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/migr-76809


If you're planning to use a T420 as a desktop, I highly suggest you
getting a docking station, you can get one really cheap these days, and
it might support dual external screens.

I just bought a T440p as a dev machine, and am running vagrant -> 
VirtualBox -> CentOS 6 to run in turn a full stack of PostgerSQL,  Java 
on Tomcat, Java and Scala on Play! and angular on the browser.

I barely notice it, and probably will have a couple of inactive VMs set 
up, so I can switch back and forth between unrelated tasks. Build 
performance is good, in part because I'm rarely compiling linking and 
provisioning more than one thing at any given moment! 
Eclipse/Maven/java/Scala are memory hogs, though, so I bought 16 GB of ram.

A much smaller netbook gave good build performance, but was constrained 
to 4 GB, and I needed at least 8 and perhaps 12, so bought a machine 
with slots (;-))

  Hi Abby,

  Googling  UEFI BIOS disable  should bring up quite a few links.  
Unfortunately, there is no standardized way of disabling the UEFI and
switching back to using BIOS.  In general, there are basically two challenges:

  1) getting the attention of the firmware that runs on initial startup
before the operating system (Windows or Linux) gets to start,  and

  2) navigating the setup menus to disable the UEFI.


  Doing the first usually requires you to press or hold down a particular
key at a particular time, which one and when depends upon the manufacturer.
Depending upon a number of factors, you may or may not see a splash screen 
providing a hint while booting.  Knowing the make and model of your computer
can also help to determine this.  Most computer manufacturers should
have user documentation in PDF format that you can download from their
web site.

  I hope that this helps.

Once you find the UEFI settings in the BIOS you may find that access to it 
is disabled. You will most likely need to set a supervisor password for the 
BIOS before it will let you have access to the UEFI settings. Just remember 
to remove the supervisor password when you are done (if you don't want/need it).

Once you find the UEFI settings in the BIOS you may find that access to it 
is disabled. You will most likely need to set a supervisor password for the 
BIOS before it will let you have access to the UEFI settings. Just remember 
to remove the supervisor password when you are done (if you don't want/need it).

Subject: [GTALUG] Ubuntu update gone bad
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1508091030010.25880@redclaw.mimosa.com>

I'm writing this at the point of annoyance.  Maybe I'll find a fix in a 
minute or two.

I took an Acer Revo out of service as an HTPC.  It was dual boot Win 7 and 
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I applied all Win 7 updates.  Fine.  Stupid, but fine.

I applied all Ubuntu 12.04 updates.  Fine.  Not even stupid.

It offered me Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  I said to go ahead.  I almost never do 
version upgrades, out of fear, but I didn't have much to lose.  And 
everyone always says Ubuntu version upgrades are smooth as silk.

Negative observation one: version upgrades take more real time than 
re-installations.  (But they should take less of my attention and care, a 
win.)

Negative observation two: I thought that the slow upgrade process could 
happen while I was asleep.  Yes, but not in one night: there were three 
steps in the middle that required me to answer a question.  It would have 
been better if the questions had been moved to the beginning or the end.  
Fedora does that.

Negative observation three:  It all appeared to work.  The updater 
disappeared from the screen (a little odd).  top(1) showed no remnant.  
So I rebooted.  Now I have the prompt:
	grub rescue>
which means I have nothing, not even Win7.  I don't think that I can type 
anything useful into that prompt.

Obviously the third is the lulu.

The fact that I am using LTS should indicate my risk aversion.

I will fix this but I will remember.

Revos have an EFI bios, right? I used to get this all the time on my
Samsung Chronos, until I blew away the dual-boot and put it back into
legacy (aka "working") BIOS mode.

Boot-Repair <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair> on a
bootable USB stick will likely fix it. Under certain circumstances,
Windows updates will routinely destroy grub, so keep this stick handy.

Message-ID: <20150809195953.7269fdc4ceced4fa6fe554fa@eol.ca>

   I have just installed Fedora_22 on my Lenovo Thinkpad T400 laptop.
I cannot get the networking to work, Ethernet or Wi-Fi.  

   I can turn Wi-Fi on, and I can see the Wi-Fi servers.  When I
connect to mine, it just sits there trying to connect until it times
out.  I tried connecting with an invalid Wi-Fi password, and it
prompted me for the correct one, so it is validating this, but not
connecting.   

   When I look at dmesg, I see a bunch of messages about authenticating
and deauthinticating to a MAC address.  This MAC address matches the
address of my router except for the last number, which is 87, and
should be 86.  Fedora_22 no longer has /var/log/messages. 

   I had some difficulties when I did the install from DVD.  A screen
came up and said "Oh no!  Something has occurred and the system can't
recover. All extensions have been disabled as a precaution."  I
searched the web and I removed xorg-x11-drv-libinput.  This got the
install working.  I removed it from the actual installed computer, as
per the instructions on the website.  I was having network problems
both before and after I did this. 

   Has anybody seen anything like this?  Fedora_20 was a fairly easy
install for ordinary mortals.  Fedora_22 seems to be a huge step
backwards.

   Thanks.

No need for this drastic action.  I've dual booted Ubuntu with Windows 
using EFI without a problem.

Yes, boot repair is an excellent tool.  The other route is to boot off 
of a Ubuntu live cd, click on try Ubuntu and mount your drives to /mnt.  
Chroot to /mnt and try to to reinstall grub.  Look for errors and 
correct them.

I've seen this with Linux Mint Debian Edition (the first release from
March 2014); I bypassed the problem by assigning a static IP address
to the laptop (Asus netbook) for that particular location.

I believe the access point is at fault in my case, since the Asus
netbook has no trouble connecting to APs at other locations.

Message-ID: <CAOO1MfutDkpa6RM2SuK97uUhbP93gyO5zMGXM-wjqct9eE0jGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
I am writing a bourne shell script, to read a binary file as input and take
action depending on the contents of the file.

The file is a mixture of ASCII and binary codes (such as ASCII filed
lengths and flags).

I have the processing already done in C. I would like to convert it to a
bourne shell.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what combination of tools I may be able
to use?

You don't need "tools" to write Bourne shell script, because the script
itself is text file.  If you're talking about shell wrapper, then
    #! /bin/sh
    your_c_program "$@"
would call your C program with the same arguments.  You can use "exec"
to replace the script, if you want PID to be the same, ie.
    #! /bin/sh
    exec your_c_program "$@"

If you're only trying to look at the ASCII data (and trying to process
binary data in Bash seems like a poor idea), then you may want to look
at the "strings" command:

$ strings $(which ls)

"strings" is part of the binutils package on Debian.

If you have the program in C to process data, going to bash is like
swapping a large truck for a turtle. Bash will be orders of magnitude
slower, and you will have to take a lot of care to pipe data all over awk,
sed, tr and the like.
Bash is a terrible choice, python (or perl, or PHP) would be faster. Way
faster.

You jumped over 3 other releases in between. One of which would have been 
another LTS release. I have done upgrades in Ubuntu when I used to run it 
and I usually had no problem. In my case I would do a series of upgrades 
when I only two or three releases behind the current one. If I am too far 
behind then I would go the route of a fresh install.

You are jumping up by four releases and you can find some programs were 
replaced by other programs which can complicate the upgrade process in some 
situations.

Yes, they often can.

I prefer to do the updates during the day so I can keep an eye on it. There 
are extra questions that can be asked of you during an install that would 
bring the process to a halt until an answer is provided.

This could be one of a few issues. It could be a failed update to the grub 
bootloader, it could be the Windows update changed the boot partitions or 
removed the grub bootloader, or possibly a UEFI related boot issue.

If (or, rather when) Windows update messed with the bootloader it usually 
makes it so the system boots straight to Windows. Seeing a grub prompt means 
that is not the case here.

You can go in to the BIOS of your computer and disabled UEFI boot. I ran in 
to an issue with it on one of my systems. If that isn't the case you may be 
able to issue some commands at the grub prompt to get the system to boot.

I don't know if things are the same with grub 2 but in grub 1 you would use 
four commands. "root", "linux", "initrd", and finally "boot" to get the 
system up.

For example:
root (hd0,1)
linux /boot/vmlinuz-<insert-kernel-version-here>
initrd /boot/initrd.img-<insert-kernel-version-here>
boot

The root line would point to the drive and partition containing the linux 
kernel and initrd files (what you know often know as /boot when the system 
is running).

The linux and initrd lines can take command line completion so you can hit 
the tab key to see which kernel and/or initrd files are available. The last 
word "boot" takes no arguments. It uses the information from the first three 
commands and attempts to boot your system.

Message-ID: <20150810200226.GA5950@node1.localdomain>

Hi all,

With Debian, you can install all desktops (kde, gnome, xfce, etc) from
ISO at first, and then choose which the desktop when you log in via
gdm/kdm.

Is there a version for Ubuntu which allows you to do that?
Right now, you have to choose/install different ISO for each desktop.

Or, do I have to start with "minimal install", and then install all
the desktops afterwards?  But, I don't know if gdm/kdm will pick up
the desktops.

I will stick to my keytronic (currently an E03600U2).  I hate the noise
of the old IBMs.  Fortunately the model M is durable enough to
sufficiently punish anyone who tries to use one nearby that the keyboard
won't suffer any damage and can still be used by someone else that
politely does so when they are alone. :)

That is NOT what you want to do.  You want to disable 'secureboot' not
disable 'UEFI'.  Not the same thing.  Nothing wrong with UEFI at all,
just secureboot.

What you want is to enter the setup and find the setting that turns off
secureboot, and that is it.  Booting in UEFI mode is perfectly fine and
most linux distributions have no issue with UEFI (and grub2 works fine
with it too).  UEFI also means you get to use GPT for your partition
setup, which is much nicer than the old primary/extended/logical partition
crap we used to deal with.

If you really want, you can look for CSM (Compatibility Support Module)
boot mode and use that, which should boot with BIOS compatibility services
allowing you to install older OSs that require a BIOS.

Well for Windows 8 certification Microsoft required that there must be
a user controllable setting to turn it off (although it must be on by
default).  I am under the impression that Windows 10 certification no
longer requires that such an option exist, so unfortunately some system
makers might stupidly decide to not have such an option (of course no
sane person should then buy from them, but many people won't know that).

Hi William,

This doesn't answer your original question, but I'd install minimal
system and then install all the desktop environments, because minimal
system is a lot easier to troubleshoot than installer environment.

You then can install all the desktop environments you want with tasksel
tool -- https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tasksel

KDM/GDM are smart enough to detect all desktop environment, though you'd
be better off installing only one of these.

https://www.google.com/search?q=kdm+select+desktop+environment&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAmoVChMI76vC4ayfxwIVAxs-Ch05KQA1&biw=1600&bih=728

In debian these days, you can install one of the desktops by just
installing one of the task-desktop packages, I don't know if this method
trickled down to ubuntu yet.

That's nothing compared to the dire and baroque things the coworker who
used to sit across from me was going to do if anyone brought in a Model
M.  Of course, you have to be faster than the proprietor of said keyboard
if you want to do any of that.

At least the Lenovo keyboards work uses consistently hit the minimum
standard for a usable keyboard.  But it seems a shame not to be able to
do my best coding there.  There's really nothing as nice to type on as
a quarter-century-old Model M.

And hey, if I wanted to make noise why bother with a Model M when I can
fire up my chainsaw?  :-)

I also like the M keyboard.  I picked up a few several years ago.  The
only issue was I had to get a PS/2 - USB adapter to use the keyboard
with my KVM.

Message-ID: <CAOO1MfuQyjfN7VTdkSFh=Ho9YjMitwk_9V9AtFJLbkcSiOYCCg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the complete background.

I need to write a tool to run on Linux that will do an LDAP lookup on
Active Directory for a specific 'hidden' attribute that tells the client
which Active Directory site it belongs to. The tool is part of a larger
suite (keytab creation, krb5.conf config etc) already written in Bourne.
Unfortunately, the value that is returned from AD is a binary blob. So
while I can call ldapsearch to retrieve the value, I still need something
to process/decompress the attribute.

The algorithm to decompress the blob is the same as is outlined in RFC
1035. But Windows implementations of such are sparsely documented.

I needed to ensure that I understood the decompression algorithm so I wrote
some fairly portable code to do both the LDAP lookup and  perform the
decompression of the binary blob.

So while I can port the code from Windows to Linux fairly easily, I would
like the tool to be converted to Bourne so that it can be a single script
(rather than having to deploy a script and an executable).

The Restaurant Formerly Know As Love At First Bite won the vote with
31.25% of the vote.

The next vote will be done by ranking ballet instead of the one choice.

I am going off this list <http://wiki.gtalug.org/pre-meeting_dinner>
and you are welcome to add more restuarants.

Unfortunately each generation has different keyboards so they are
not comparable.  The x30 models went to chicklet keyboards (which I so
far am very happy with), but the x40 (no idea if the x40p is the same)
has had a lot of complaints about keyboard latyout and most of all the
changes to the trackpad and trackpoint buttons, although the some updates
have fixed that again (like the W541).

I think the x20 was the last with the classic thinkpad keyboard, but I
am not entirely sure since I never used one myself.

The W530 is perfectly portable.  It closes and fits in a large bag and
can be carried places. :)

I would hate to do it on a regular basis though.

It does support 32GB ram and in my case has a Core-i7 CPU, which means
quad core + hyperthreading at about 3GHz.  The fact it has a 170W power
supply probably tells something about the power consumption.

Actually I suspect it is french canadian keyboard.  One of the worst
keyboard layouts ever made.  Looking at some pictures, that is in fact
the case.

Of course things can be fixed:
http://us.estore.asus.com/collections/replacement-keyboard/products/g751jm-1a-k-b_us_module-as-90nb06g1-r30300

I did that with my wife's ideapad a few years ago (partially because
the keyboard broke and it was easier to get a US replacement which was
also desirable).

I suspect the newer chicklet style thinkpad keyboard might actually be
an improvement then.

I suspect I would be the opposite.  I like the W530 keyboard (which is
the same as the T530).

Too noisy and a bit too hard to press for my liking.  Old IBm keyboards
never die, but I sure don't miss them.

You might get noticed carrying one of those.

Well from what I can find the process is:

When you see Toshiba logo, hit F2, then you should be in the UEFI (BIOS)
settings.

Under security tab there should be an option for 'secure boot' which
you want to set to disabled.  If you want to keep windows working,
that should be all you change, and then you should be able to install
linux as long as the distribution is new enough to support UEFI booting.
If you don't want to keep windows and you want to use an older style
distribution that does not do UEFI booting, then you have to also find
the "CSM boot" setting (under advanced/system settings) and turn that on.
That will break booting windows 8.1 on the machine though.  I would
personally stick with UEFI booting these days.

I had this same problem on an Acer laptop until I discovered you need to
enter a password and enable the password.

When you are finished disabling things, you can then disable the password.

I mentioned the other day to someone on this list that you may have to set a 
supervisor password in the BIOS before you can change the UEFI and/or 
secureboot setting. Give that a try and see if it helps. Just remember to 
removed the supervisor password if you don't really want it long term.

Something has come up and William will not be able to give his talk
tonight on Samba. We will be rescheduling him for the September
meeting.

Tonight's meeting will be a Round Table Q&A Session where we will take
questions from the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts
to answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way
to meet fellow members of our community and discover the skill sets we
each bring to the table.

Message-ID: <CAEnxSC6U1NhkEjVD8m3JL07vFOFqa=O7GmNNm0VKxEfrTPuLQw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm writing a Python script that checks git repositories in the user's
home folder (other folders is an option that should be added soon) and
then tells you their status, both local and remote.  I want to release
it publicly using github, but I'd like to maintain a private repo, and
only push certain releases to github.  I admit this is mostly because
I keep extensive notes in the source code and am perhaps a bit
embarrassed what those notes say both about my memory and my limited
coding skills.  I should probably just get over it - particularly
since the code itself probably says more than the notes.  But - git is
flexible enough that I imagine that this is an option: has anybody
done this?

As my knowledge of Python is somewhat rudimentary, so is my knowledge
of git.  The only thing I'm fairly sure about is that rebasing will be
involved.  If I wasn't concerned about pull requests (as novel as it
seems now, I like to hope they'll happen) this could be done in any
number of sloppy ways.  But it seems like I need either a branch or a
separate repo (which, and why?) that includes only the github data,
and I need my private repo to have the github one as a "tracked
branch" or something like that that I can merge from.  Is this making
sense, or am I thinking about it all wrong?

I welcome all suggestions and thoughts, thanks.

If you don't want to share the commit messages you can change the easily
with `git commit --amend` (see this
<https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/>).

If you are afraid of things you have committed you can use `git rebase
-i HEAD~10` which will allow you to squash the last 10 commits and allow
you to rewrite the commit message.

I would clone a new repo to test how it's going to work. You don't want
an detached head :-).

Have you seen this: <https://github.com/mixu/gr> it's basically what you
are doing written in Node.js.

I don't think this is so much a Python matter as a question of how you deal
with your work in your branches.  (And maybe I'm wrong, but I'll run
through the "squash" answer quickly!)

The thing that I'll often do that is like this is to open local branches to
fix bugs, and then, when preparing for release, to merge the results into
the branch I want to push publicly, using the --squash option to get rid of
any cruddy little commits that might seem embarrassing.

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5308816/how-to-use-git-merge-squash

The first example seems pretty good...

Suppose I did my work (with a bunch of dumb little commits) on the "bugfix"
branch, and I want to put it into the "master" branch, voila...

git checkout master
git merge --squash bugfix
git commit
git push some-public-remote master

This addresses the problem of "cleaning up messy commits."

If the problem is that you want some of your python sources to get
released, and others not, then you'd presumably need to have some sort of
tool that rewrites the Python to remove (most? all?) comments.  Writing a
"let me bowlderize the python code" tool seems likely to get real messy...

A co-worker has suggested I create a new repo and simply copy the
files I want to put on github into it.  Since there will only be three
or four files, this seems reasonable.  Likewise, future commits could
be copied over with less comments in the code and a public-friendly
commit message.  And (possibly most important), the private repo could
have a branch with the github repo (and its pull requests) as a
remote.  This is so far seeming like the simplest solution.

Well you might have to type an admin password to unlock some settings.

But windows 8 logo certification requires that the end user be able to
change that setting, so there has to be a way.  Otherwise it would not
be allowed to ship with a windows 8 logo sticker on it.

Some places say that if a supervisor password is set it has to be cleared
before you can change secure boot.

And you have to be sure windows 8 is really shutdown before entering
the bios, which supposedly you do by holding shift down when telling
windows to shutdown/restart.

So you have to set a supervisor/admin password for the bios before you

Well thinkpads have a bios setting to swap fn and control for those
that prefer it that way (and in the case of my wife's thinkpad when she
broke the fn key, being able to swap it with control meant a key for
controling the keyboard light and brightness existed again until we got
a replacement keyboard).

Dell has the keys wrong of course and no option to swap them.  Also their
keyboard sucks and the touchpad and trackpoint are awful.  Dell sucks. :)

My experience with open source is that it is undercommented, if indeed it
has any comments at all. (Darktable, I'm looking at you.) It's enormously
helpful to understand the writer's thinking process. People can skip over
the comments or even do a selective erase if they don't like them.

Then, if the reader understands your objective and finds your code clunky
in achieving that objective, they can show their superior grasp by
providing an alternative (often more concise and difficult to understand)
solution.

I'm reminded of stories of Gauss, the famous mathematician and scientist
of whom it was said 'he removed all the scaffolding from his
constructions, so it appeared he arrived at the result by magic'. There's
too much of that kind of thinking in software.

Subject: [GTALUG] Locking KDE 5 screen from shell script
Message-ID: <55CAF405.5050805@rjonasz.org>

I recently installed kde5 on debian stretch.  I have a yubikey which I 
use to log in with.  I'd like to lock the screen when I remove the 
yubikey.  I have it working with cinnamon and lxde but I can't quite get 
it with kde.  I can lock the screen if I run the shell script from a 
terminal as root but when I remove the yubikey the shell script returns 
error code 1.

Here's my shell scripts:

ykgone.sh

Konsole output
#! /bin/sh
if [ -z "$(lsusb | grep Yubikey)" ] ; then
        if [ ! -z "$(ps aux | grep cinnamon-session | grep -v grep)" ] ; 
then
                /bin/su rjonasz -c "DISPLAY=:0 
cinnamon-screensaver-command -l"
        elif [ ! -z "$(ps aux | grep startkde | grep -v grep)" ] ; then
                /usr/bin/sudo -u rjonasz -H -i  /usr/local/bin/lockkde.sh
        else
                /bin/su rjonasz -c "DISPLAY=:0 xscreensaver-command --lock"
        fi
fi


lockkde.sh

Konsole output
#! /bin/sh

kde_pid=`pidof kdeinit5`
export `cat /proc/$kde_pid/environ|grep -ao 
'DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=[[:graph:]]*'`
/usr/bin/qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock


I can't seem to figure this one out.

Thanks for any help!

You could change this line
ps aux | grep cinnamon-session | grep -v grep

to this
pgrep cinnamon-session

It's cleaner and works well.

To answer the main question, try to install bashdb and run the script thru
it. It's the bash debugger, it's far more powerful than bash -vx.

Are you sure the PATH is set the same when run from a terminal versus
when run by your key being removed?

Try for debugging to do at the start of the script:

echo $PATH > /tmp/$$.path.env

Then after running it both ways you should have a file for each PID that
did it that you can compare.

Message-ID: <20150813004312.GA13336@node1.localdomain>

I bought a $40 Dell Latitude E6400 without harddisk:
    - Core 2 Duo P8400, 2GB DDR2-800, 1280x800 screen
    - DVD-RW, battery, 130W power adapter
    - SATA interface for disk
    - keyboard is better than ThinkPad T43.  A little heavier going
      down, but return is very crisp.  This was main reason for buying
      it.
I added SSD, and installed Windows-10 to see if all components are
working.  And, they were.  Then, I decided to upgrade its old BIOS (from
A14 to A34).  Windows gave me error, and told me to reboot.  Well, now,
the laptop won't boot!

So, it's free for anyone needing parts.  I can bring it to next TLUG

    - Core 2 Duo P8400, 2GB DDR2-800, 1280x800 screen
    - DVD-RW, battery, 130W power adapter
    - SATA interface for disk
    - keyboard is better than ThinkPad T43.  A little heavier going
      down, but return is very crisp.  This was main reason for buying
      it.
I added SSD, and installed Windows-10 to see if all components are
working.  And, they were.  Then, I decided to upgrade its old BIOS (from
A14 to A34).  Windows gave me error, and told me to reboot.  Well, now,
the laptop won't boot!

So, it's free for anyone needing parts.  I can bring it to next TLUG
meeting.

If you can still get in to BIOS, check the settings. Particularly the ones 
involving UEFI and secureboot. Someone on this list could tell you how they 
should be set to keep Windows happy.

You could also try booting a live Linux CD or DVD to check the drives.

I can't even get to BIOS.  Power LED comes on and few other keyboard
related LEDs.  Then, it turns off.

Subject: [GTALUG] Alternative to KOrganizer (KDE) ?
Message-ID: <20150813060013.GA18962@node1.localdomain>

KOrganizer is a calendar program in KDE.  And, it's the only thing
that's tying me to KDE desktop.  

What calendar program do you guys use in other desktops?  I know of and
test drove
    - Evolution (GNOME)
    - Orage (XFCE)
But, they can't pull me off KDE, yet.
