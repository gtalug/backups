Subject: [GTALUG] Xrandr problem
Message-ID: <20141001003622.GA17368@amber>

I have an annoying problem.  I run a two-monitor setup with
xrandr, one monitor in portrait and the other in landscape
mode.  I set xrandr in the .xinitrc file, and it works well.
The only problem is that when I quit the window manager (in
this case goomwwm), the screen goes to black and I'm pretty
sure I never return to the console (blind typing produces no
results).  The computer itself keeps running; I can ssh in.
Any advice or suggestions?  I can't quite figure how to turn
xrandr *off* once it's been set in .xinitrc.  Oh, and if I
boot without xrandr, I go straight back to the console when
I quit X (as it should).

I don't really know how to modify xrandr but I can tell you that part of
your problem is that
xrandr does NOT like multi-monitor setups. This I found out the hard way
when I tried to setup
my multi-monitor system. I had to not enable xrandr as part of my solution.
Perhaps some time
in the future the authors of xrandr will update their solution to better
reflect the real world.

How did you set up your multimonitor system without xrandr?  I'm perfectly
willing to do it some other way -- I'm committed to the solution, not the
means.

Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,

I have been appointed the election's returning officer, aka the guy who
counts the votes.

There are three openings for the board this year. We are looking for people
to fill the vacancies. If you wish to run for the board please send me your
name. Officially, I will need a member to second your nomination, but that
can be done at the AGM in October.

Although this is not a big commitment of time, please understand that it
does involve a commitment. There is one monthly meeting of the executive
which includes the board to discuss operational issues that you are
expected to attend.

Thanks,

Bill

You may recall the "One Laptop Per Child" computers.  They were built to
use mesh among the devices.  However, mesh technology has been used in
amateur radio for at least 30 years.  Of course, with FireChat on smart
phones, it's more readily available.

Sorry for the blank message!! (to the list!!)

I'm running nvidia graphics cards (2 connected to monitors) so its a royal
pain
but I'm running the nvidia drivers. Its not that easy to set up the first
time (I spent
a lot of time the first time) but now its a painful process but its quite
doable.

You need to remove the nouveau driver. Means that first you need to get
your system
running on something else and then you black list nouveau and then you
install the
nvidia drivers and then you need to setup all the goodies and then you can
turf the nouveau
drivers and then you have OK performance.

Hi Peter,

I'm curious to see how your setting up your screens in .xinitrc.
Can you post it?

Follow up question, do any other WMs have an issue exiting with your 
xrandr setup?


For comparison, I'm attaching a script I use to setup various secondary 
monitors with my laptop. As this is a laptop I defined a 'default' that 
sets all other outputs but the LCD to off.

If you run it like below,

     SETDISPLAYS_DBG=0 setdisplays rightof

the script will output the command it would have run, so you can 
investigate it.

     xrandr --output LVDS --auto --primary --output VGA-0 --auto 
--right-of LVDS

Your output names will differ based on your hardware and potentially 
your video driver.

Good question.  I'll try cwm and dwm the next time I'm near that computer.

Hey everyone,

It's not entirely a Linux thing, but it's certainly a Toronto thing.

Anyone know a repair shop which will do Viewsonic Projectors?

I'm under extended third party warranty.  Viewsonic recommended somebody up in Northern Scarborough.   They have a $50 inspection fee (credited to your repair) which is... okay, but I hope I could find something more downtown, but equally reputable and affordable.

If there were no warranty, I would crack it open and look for capacitors :-)

If the estimate exceeds the value, I pay the $50, but I send the paperwork off to the insurance company and collect the purchase price.   So reputable means they'll get the estimate close, they've done viewsonic warranty work, have nice looking paper and accept credit cards.

Thanks,

-Mike

I just wondering what people's current experiences are with cheap Linux web
hosting.  Right now I'm using vps.net and while they're cheap it's not
uncommon to have a 10hr downtime (which I'm in the middle of this
morning).  They don't seem to have any sort of basic monitoring of their
nodes to automatically be notified when a system is down (at least not on
an individual node level), they rely on me contacting them.

Has anyone had experience with digitalocean or linode for fairly long term
hosting?  I've only used digitalocean for occasional VPN use but have had
no issues.

I have used HostPapa for a number of years and I am quite happy with them.

Never any down time that I noticed. And they added a PHP add-on that I 
requested. That impressed me on a shared host.

I have been using Linode for ~15 years and can't say anything bad
about them. They are great. But there have been a few rough patches
the in the past three years (the source code for their VPS management
console got leaked on the internet).

I'm a little scared of DigitalOcean after reading about them on Hacker
News. Apparently when the server has a hardware failure it's protocol
for them to delete all VPS on the server and make everyone start from
scratch (they do provided a backup services but it cost extra money).
I run a small dokku instance on DO and it has never happened to me.

I am using frantech.ca for more than a year, and only got a couple hours of

I haven't lost any data.

And they are cheap. I managed to get a 256MB KVM VPS 250GB Dedicated Space

Wow, that's some pretty good deals!  I have a couple projects that need
lots of storage space but memory and cpu are secondary.  It seems their
250GB unit is $7/mo now, but that's still amazing.

I guess I should have specified that I was looking for non-shared hosting.
I usually need to install my own things that aren't available in shared
hosting environments.  I also like the freedom of being able to install and
run whatever I like, especially services that run in the background.

If you pay one year in advance you will pay $5.36/mo. That's what I did...

Now I have my own private 250GB Dropbox (owncloud) paying a few dollars...
And my own VPN provider, seedbox, testing webserver, DNS server... it's fun!

This is a VPS. You own the box. You can install whatever OS you want
(Linux, a couple BSDs, even WIndows), wherever you want. The machine is
yours. Even if you kill it (rm -rf / or dd if/dev/zero of=/dev/sda), you
can go to the console and reinstall from scratch.

I've been using pair.com for over ten years, and I started using
inmotionhosting.com recently for another project. No downtime or lost data
on either provider.

I have made a bit of progress on the problem -- but only a bit.

(1) The keymap seems to be part of the problem: all the modifier keys are,
    as far as I can tell, dead.  That's why keyboard-oriented tiling WMs
    are more or less stuck (goomwwm, cwm, dwm, etc.)

(2) However, twm works as well as it ever did.

(3) I followed the gentoo guide to setting up kernel modesetting using the
    intel graphics driver, and it made things appreciably worse: when the
    kernel boots and the graphical framebuffer is supposed to take over,
    the screen simply goes black.  I can ssh in, though, and see that
    according to dmesg the inteldrmfb has successfully loaded, so what
    gives?

(4) I also got no joy whatsoever at blind-typing into the console to start
    X, which, again, I could see by ssh was supposedly running but only
    gave a blank screen.


All this on the internal 1680x1050 laptop screen.  So while it was blank,
I thought, why not, and plugged in an external VGA monitor.  Voila!  The
console came up on the external and the internal screens.  Better yet, so
did X with twm.  It seems to respond to xrandr, too.

For one last oddity, I dropped to the console, unplugged the external
monitor, and the internal screen still runs console/X just fine.  Go
figure.

This is all on a Lenovo 3000 n100 0768 model, which I recall was finicky
the last time I set it up (back in 2006 or so).  But I don't recall dead
keymaps, and, while I had to use the i915resolution hack back then, that
should all have been superseded by kernel modesetting...

Me too!

Oh, wait, sorry ...  What I meant to say is ...

I'm going.  I've gone several years in a row, and always enjoyed it.
You'll hit a couple bad talks (but that happens at every conference),
but you're pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot at several others
(and that DOESN'T happen at every conference).  Topics are
wide-ranging and can be unusual.

Me too!

Oh, wait, sorry ...  What I meant to say is ...

I'm going.  I've gone several years in a row, and always enjoyed it.
You'll hit a couple bad talks (but that happens at every conference), but you're pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot at several others (and that DOESN'T happen at every conference).  Topics are wide-ranging and can be unusual.

| From: Peter King <peter.king at utoronto.ca>

| I have made a bit of progress on the problem -- but only a bit.
| 
| (1) The keymap seems to be part of the problem: all the modifier keys are,
|     as far as I can tell, dead.  That's why keyboard-oriented tiling WMs
|     are more or less stuck (goomwwm, cwm, dwm, etc.)

Modifier keys dead?  I assume you mean shift, alt, ctrl.

That's pretty odd.  It doesn't sound like something to do with lack of
hardware support -- those are pretty standardized.

| (2) However, twm works as well as it ever did.
| 
| (3) I followed the gentoo guide to setting up kernel modesetting using the
|     intel graphics driver, and it made things appreciably worse: when the
|     kernel boots and the graphical framebuffer is supposed to take over,
|     the screen simply goes black.  I can ssh in, though, and see that
|     according to dmesg the inteldrmfb has successfully loaded, so what
|     gives?

Sometimes there is a proprietary thingee that gates the display.  For
example, I've had notebooks that had no backlight until something was,
for lack of a more accurate word, turned on.  Can you see a faint
image?

| (4) I also got no joy whatsoever at blind-typing into the console to start
|     X, which, again, I could see by ssh was supposedly running but only
|     gave a blank screen.

SSH from another machine should let you do a lot.

You can look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log

You can actually run xrandr, for example, by setting DISPLAY:
	DISPLAY=:0 xrandr
That probably assumes that you are logged in on X or the ownership
will be wrong.

Perhaps you can log in via blind typing.

| All this on the internal 1680x1050 laptop screen.  So while it was blank,
| I thought, why not, and plugged in an external VGA monitor.  Voila!  The
| console came up on the external and the internal screens.  Better yet, so
| did X with twm.  It seems to respond to xrandr, too.

Did the modifier keys work?

See if /var/log/Xorg.0.log or dmesg or something are different in the
two cases.

| This is all on a Lenovo 3000 n100 0768 model, which I recall was finicky
| the last time I set it up (back in 2006 or so).

Google?  I'm sure you've done that a lot.

Try some live distros for variety?

|  But I don't recall dead
| keymaps, and, while I had to use the i915resolution hack back then, that
| should all have been superseded by kernel modesetting...

Ask it to use VGA instead of intel?

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec_6JXVpUkoDjQuxwTpx3iaMA6K+gv1NnOgDVGoenFtrmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Over at Free Geek Toronto <http://www.freegeektoronto.org/>, we have a
small computer classroom of desktop boxes that run Linux Mint.  Every
couple of weeks we re-install clean images by hand.  The process is pretty
labourious and time-consuming, and we would much rather automate it
somehow.  However, none of us is a real sysadmin, and the tools I know a
tiny bit about (landscape, puppet) are non-free and relatively complex.  We
have very limited financial resources and our volunteer capacity is also a
bit strained right now.  Does anyone have suggestions for a simple, easy
way to automate the flashing of images in a small network?

Thanks as always -- this is my first post on the new list!

Sounds like your doing multi-card, not specifically multi-monitor, am I 
mistaken?

Xrandr works great for multi-monitor, but does indeed assume single 
card. The assumption is not Xrandr's fault, support for multi-card been 
a target feature of Xorg to for the last decade. Multi-monitor single 
cards have been "good enough" for just as long.

Fought with this today actually.
Add to your kernel boot line:

modprobe.blacklist=nouveau

This gets it gone before it's used to by the console.

Can the machines PXE boot?  If so, you could perhaps have normal boot
enabled all the time, except when you want to reflash when you change
the PXE boot server to instead boot an automatic imaging tool instead.

2 cards and 4 monitors
1 monitor in portrait and 3 in landscape mode (wouldn't mind a 4th in
landscape!)

My research showed that multi-card has been a 'hope' for a very long time.
It must be because few people actually run more than 1 graphics card.
I wish there were an easy way to slave cards together (I actually have 3
graphics
cards - - - wanted them for serious numeric processing).

One needs to NOT be running any x window stuff at that time too!

The whole process isn't very straightforward. Its a pity that nouveau
weren't just either seriously upgraded or perhaps deprecated.

Nouveau impresses me given that it is a product of reverse
engineering.

If you were to deprecate it, I would hope that you have an open source
replacement.

o1bigtenor,

Are you possibly confusing the old nv driver with the nouveau driver that replaced?

  Can you do a basic install with / ( including /root, and /usr ) on
/dev/sda1 (approx 6 to 8 gigabytes)?  *IMPORTANT*... include sshd as
part of the basic install, and have it start automatically at boot.
- "dd" the / partition to a USB key. Assuming the key is mounted as
   /media/key
  dd -bs=1M -if=/dev/sda1 -of=/media/key/imagefile

  To copy the partition back
- boot the machine to be installed, using any linux install ISO or USB
  key, then insert the USB key and "dd" the other way...
  dd -bs=1M -if=/media/key/imagefile -of=/dev/sda1

  Final customization
- remove the linux boot ISO/key and the data key and reboot the machine
- assuming sshd works, you can now do scripted final customization over
  the net, including running apt-get for updates, and copying user home
  dirs, etc, etc.
