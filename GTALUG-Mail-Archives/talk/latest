When I last looked at it a year ago there were a few being worked on on the openwrt forums. They should be searchable in the Table of Hardware.

Unfortunately it very very unlikely that any will support the non-standard VDSL2 implementation that Bell deployed in Ontario.

Well, at least you don't have to worry about encryption.  ;-)

BTW, many years ago, I used to overhaul Teletype machines.  Back then, I

Subject: [GTALUG] How can I read html email stored in Maildir format?
Message-ID: <20141101023049.GA19776@waltdnes.org>

  My 7-year-old modem/router is starting to occasionally get flakey, so
I ordered a new one from Teksavvy.  Canada Post sent a tracking update,
and it was unreadable in mutt, not to mention that 90% of the email was
graphics...

-- Mutt: Attachments
  I     1 EM ALERT Form         [text/html, quoted, utf-8, 24K]
  I     2 filename.BMP                [image/bmp, base64, 109K]
  I     3 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]
  I     4 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 16K]

  I     7 filename.BMP                 [image/bmp, base64, 36K]

  I copied the email to a text file, consulted with "Mr. Google", and
found the sed invocation to turn it into something that Firefox could
read.  According to the tracking link, the modem/router has been
accepted at Chatham and is now on route to Richmond Hill.  Since I live
in Vaughan, that means I'll probably have to pick it up at a depot
somewhere.

  Anyhow, back to topic... what apps/programs are capable of *DIRECTLY*
reading HTML mails that are stored in Maildir format?

  A possible compromise... ask if they have any router/modems that allow
you to access a CLI.  Once you have that level of access, you can
probably tweak firewall rules, etc, at will.

[Scott suggests you mean VDSL2.]

I have a VDSL2 modem of a brand and firmware mandated by Bell.  Even 
though they are not my ISP.  The mandate is brutal: neither end of the 
wire actually conforms to the VDSL2 standard, as far as I know.

I don't want to use their router or wireless for a whole host of reasons.  
So I don't.  I use the thing only as a modem and have my own router (and 
separate wireless access point).  My router is actually a discarded 
notebook running CentOS 6.

I've heard a rumour that the Modem/Router/Access-point box makes traffic 
slower if it is only used as a modem.  I've not investigated because 
there's nothing I'm willing do do about it.

And another thing.  I bought a wireless router that apparently runs a 
manufacturer's hacked version of OpenWRT.  But stock OpenWRT won't run 
because there are no open source drivers for the broadcom wireless part.  
How annoying / frustrating / disgusting.

Hmm,

That's a bit annoying, especially as you would feel you supported a bunch of scams.?

What brand is it so that the rest of the group can avoid the mistake?

Hey Scott,

It's actually ADSL2+
The modem is gonna be used for an older 7mbit down/1mbit up line, so I hope
my options aren't as limited.

Then I'd just get an ADSL2+ modem without a built in router and then
use your own preferred router running OpenWRT.

New ADSL2+ Modem/Routers can be had for $20 or less. Just drop them in bridge mode if and enjoy.

I bought this:
A Netgear AC1450 (refurb).
<http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833122615&cm_re=ac1450-_-33-122-615-_-Product&AID=10657534&PID=749547&SID=rfdcb-d725&nm_mc=AFC-C8JunctionCA&cm_mmc=AFC-C8JunctionCA-_-na-_-na-_-na>
Quite inexpensive for the resources.  It was even cheaper a couple of
days ago: an astonishing $59.99 (but I had already made the purchase).

Resources: GigaHz LAN and WAN, dual-core ARM SOC; 256M RAM, 128M NAND Flash, one USB3 and
one USB2 port, wifi: an+ac, 3x3:3.
<https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Netgear_R6300_v2>

The firmware can be flashed to become another model, the R6300v2:
<http://advancedhomeserver.com/upgrade-a-netgear-ac1450-router-to-ac1750-r6300v2/>
I've done that.

Here's the OpenWRT forum thread on this device
<https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=46758>
Message 24 is where I heard that the stock firmware is a version of
OpenWRT.  25 explains why that isn't good enough.  Currently it is
partially supported by OpenWRT.

I'm using it as an access point.  It is not one of my my internet
gateways.

If you search the Table of Hardware, there are plenty of device that 
list ADSL2+ hardware, but spot checks showed hit or miss for Working or 
Not Working.

I really would recommend to just pursue a good OpenWRT router and then 
hang a DSL modem off the WAN port.

Examples of Inexpensive single Ethernet DSL modem/routers.

TP-link TD-8616
http://www.tplink.ca/en/products/details/?model=TD-8616
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_1059_1060&item_id=4887159

I've used a few of these, the tend to do alright. I've had some 
intermittent issues with these on know to be dodgy phone lines, that a 
more expensive modem wouldn't run into.


D-Link DL-520B
http://ca.dlink.com/products/connect/adsl2-ethernet-modem-2/
http://www.canadacomputers.com/product_info.php?cPath=27_1059_1060&item_id=036727

No personal experience with these, but know a handful of folks that find 
them to work well enough.

Or, like I said, keep it simple and use just an ADSL2+ modem without a
built in router so you don't have to fiddle with setting bridge mode.

I've found TP-Link products to be inexpensive and reliable, such as:

If that is just a modem, as it claims, why does it list this feature:

Does it do slightly-deep packet inspection, peering inside the PPPoE
packets?

There is a local web server to manage the thing.  Perhaps that's why
it has a firewall.

More of a meta comment...

I daresay I haven't had much luck finding devices that run OpenWRT well.

I have run through the hardware support list in parallel with reading stock
lists at
local computer shops, and found, erm, "inadequate overlap."   The last time
I
bought a router, it looked like it *might* support OpenWRT, however that has
remained nascent, so I'm still running DD-WRT.

I'm a bit suspicious that OpenWRT isn't sufficiently supported by "staffing"
(of whatever sort) to keep up with the normal flow of new router hardware
(there's naturally going to be new stuff, as all the vendors need to sell
something new next year).

My impression is that:

- reverse engineering is slower than new gadgets get adopted.
  Broadcom is very bad for open source.  Atheros has been much better
  (at least until it was bought by Qualcomm).

- it appears that support for NAND flash is not mainstreamed in OpenWRT.  
  Yet that seems to be the future direction of hardware.

  (technical sketch: ordinary old flash can be written a word at a
  time, kind of like RAM (but more slowly).  NAND can only be zeroed a
  large block at a time.  And NAND flash is much shorter-lived.  (But
  it is cheaper and more dense.) So you need layer of software to do
  wear-leveling and to create an abstraction that kind of looks like a
  disk.  There are several competing systems to do that.  UBI is one
  that is being adopted for some OpenWRT projects.)

- lots of OpenWRT work is itch-scratching.  It often involves git
  commits but not wiki updates.  So if you care about a device, google
  for it + openwrt.  There are often postings about work in progress,
  sometimes even completed.

- turn it around: buy hardware that is known to be good for OpenWRT.
  Unfortunately, buying stuff that does not support the latest
  standards is a bit discouraging.  The CeroWRT folks (downstream from
  OpenWRT, and very interesting) only support the NetGear WNDR3700v2
  and equivallent -- no support for 802.11ac.

  The TP-Link Archer C7 v2 looks good, cheap, and might be supported.
  Beware: the v1's wireless will never be supported; the C8 is not as
  good, more expensive, and isn't supported (it has the same Broadcom
  chip as is in my Netgear R6300v2).

	<http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr7500>
	<http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/32498-tp-link-archer-c7-v2-reviewed>

So why did I buy the Broadcom-based Netgear R6300v2?

I was bargain hunting and in a hurry.  I read the OpenWRT thread on
the Netgear R6300v2 and didn't read to the end; it looked as if
support had just appeared.  And the raw hardware of the Netgear looked
much better than the TP-Link: 8 times as much flash, lots more ram,
much faster processor, USB3.  I failed to notice that the actual
wireless performance wasn't quite as good.

The final hook was that I was buying a somewhat cheaper model than an
R6300v2 and upgrading it by flashing.  I thought I was getting away
with something.

I had actually started with a Future Shop / Best Buy bargain on the
TP-Link C7 (for a v2, but that wasn't in the specs.) but they ran out
of stock.

The FS/BB blow-out might be a sign that the c7 is being replaced by
the inferior c8.  Get'em while you can.

I was puzzled by that as well. (I don't own this device.) Could be it
was incorrectly copied from the spec's for a combination modem/router.
There's no mention of a firewall feature in the user guide, so it's
either incorrect or something that's not user configurable. Protection
from buffer overflow/DOS attacks perhaps?

I'd /generally/ agree, but like all consumer networking manufacturing,
they'll change the hardware inside to suit their costs and not
necessarily update the name or model number. If you're running ARM or a
non-Intel Linux, that change in chipset ? no matter how small (oh hai
Realtek) ? means the difference between a working network adaptor or a
USB-attached ambient air-warmer.

So saying, I had a computer that worked solidly for many years using the
cheapest TP-Link network card and (ack bleaah) NDISwrapper.

cheers,
 Stewart

I often want the same thing (or mbox files, or ...) and the best I could
come up with was running an IMAP server on localhost (dovecot in my case)
and using thunderbird.

I think I found a few clients that claimed to deal with maildir and/or
mbox (most often the latter if I recall correctly) but was dissatisfied
with them for one reason or another.

Day to day use, I use mutt with a .mailcap file that invokes elinks
on html when necessary, and can toss it to firefox if needed (which
is more complicated when firefox is local and mutt is on a remote
machine), but that often doesn't include the images in the message
display.

Mail used to be so much simpler ...

Hope that helps!

I appear to be invisible to modern electronics as well. The faucets at
work are all motion-activated. Or not, in my case. I have to hold my
hands and wiggle them *just so* in order to get water, but as soon as
I start making washing motions with my hands the water stops. The
paper towel dispensers have also been electronicated, so it's equally
difficult to dry my hands as it is to wash them.

As I mentioned in another post, I've worked with these. The are a full 
router. You never find 'modem only' devices any more. The functionality 
for a router is so damn cheap. But they are also so cheap that you can 
wilfully waste that router functionality.

 From a design perspective you grab System on a Chip, many which come 
with two or more Ethernet devices built in, connect one of them to the 
ADSL chip-set, the other to an external jack and slap it on a board with 
some LEDs. A little software and your done.

I bought one of these this past week. I'd been periodically checking the 
stock at Canada Computers and they finally had a v2 in stock.

I gave it a once over with the stock fireware just to make sure the 
hardware wasn't DOA and then installed OpenWRT.

Here are some of my very first impressions. I only just started 
configuring it. I have only gotten this far.

1) Does it turn on, and flash easily?
2) Can I use the web UI?
3) Do my devices see the wifi and connect?

The answer to all of the above is yes.


OpenWrt Barrier Breaker 14.07 / LuCI Trunk (0.12+svn-r10530)

Notes:
The web ui is a startling jump from Attitude Adjustment 12.09. The older 
UI had this sort of 'tab-like' layout. Where now the tabs are menus from 
a single top bar, everything piece of functionality under the same 
headings though. It feels like it's more friendly towards mobile 
devices, and also is shinier.

The front Wireless LEDs do not light up.


OpenWrt Chaos Calmer (Trunk/Dev)

Notes:
The nightly firmware image is minimal! The web UI (luci) is not 
included, use only if you ready telnet/ssh in and use opkg to install 
what you need. Reverted back to Barrier Breaker for the time being.


I'll have more to say on it after I switch to using this as my primary 
wifi solution.

I've finally got around to copying my mail from gmail to my home
machine.  I'm using getmail ( http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/ ,
also in the Ubuntu repos), but it barfs after collecting my 80,000
messages across six hours - and then considers the next run to be
"new" so it doesn't do collect only new mail, it collects it all
again.  And having not spotted that these are the same messages, it
duplicates them and the backup directory is now twice the size it
should be ...  I'm using IMAP, and yes, it's set to only collect new
mail.

So has anyone got getmail fully working with gmail, or does someone
have another recommended way of fetching gmail onto a local machine?
Thanks.

I'm using offlineimap with the 'realdelete no' option so I doesn't
delete the message on the remote server.

offlineimap is really cool because you can call a Python function in
it's config file. So if you didn't wanted to store your password you
could write a Python lookup function to check your Password
Manager[1]. It also allows for name translations so you can work with
Gmail annoying '[Gmail]/...' folders.

[1]: This is an example of one written for the Gnome Keyring:

I considered one of these recently.   It really has no router.

That said, for about $1 more, you can get the 8617 which looks identical, but has a router :-)

I cant recall which I bought.  Works fine so far.

Ah sorry.

I confused the TD-8816 with the TD-8616 you linked.

I've not seen the 8616 in stores.

I would bet a nice dinner that the only significant difference is software.
