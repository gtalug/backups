it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Hello,

The better way would probably to start a new thread in the new list and ask
in the old one to see who didn?t receive the new thread/topic.

Best,

I think that this will be MY LAST POST TO tlug at ss.org.
And it is my first post to talk at gtalug.org.

I don't know if the "unsubscribe" is necessary or even a good idea.

How are the old and new lists connected?

I subscribed on Monday evening to the new ones and have not unsubscribed 
from the old one.  I have not received any double-posts.  In fact, all 
messages I've seen seem to be from the old list.

I'm sending this message to both old and new lists.  Let's see what 
happens.

If there is no automatic cross-posting, one should stay subscribed to both 
old and new lists.

They are hardly connected, really.

They're managed on separate servers, and there isn't any sort of gatewaying
between them, except insofar as one might simultaneously post to both (as
you and I have both just done).

I agree; there is not any particular value or need to unsubscribe from the
old list.

At some point, there will be a final message, hopefully an intentional
"This Is The Final Message" one, and the old list will be turned off, no
more postings allowed.  (Sorta nice if messages "bounce" in some meaningful
way as opposed to disappearing into the aether, alas, I don't imagine that
would be easy to test, particularly as there's very little maintenance
going on in the elder environment.)

Subject: [GTALUG] darktable - a rather good photo workflow for Linux
Message-ID: <5410E4B1.8020500@gmail.com>

Hi,

Don't know if there are too many photography nerds here, but I've
discovered a very nice package for managing raw photo publishing:
darktable - http://www.darktable.org/

It's not really a pixel editor like Gimp. You can add a whole variety of
transforms and filters to a group of pictures, and then export them all,
leaving the original files untouched. It works in 32 bit/pixel floating
point, so you don't get quantization issues.

darktable's UI is a little odd, and it will take you a few hours to
learn how everything works. After you learn, it works just fine.

cheers,
 Stewart
