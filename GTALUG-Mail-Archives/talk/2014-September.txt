diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Hello,

The better way would probably to start a new thread in the new list and ask
in the old one to see who didn?t receive the new thread/topic.

How are the old and new lists connected?

I subscribed on Monday evening to the new ones and have not unsubscribed 
from the old one.  I have not received any double-posts.  In fact, all 
messages I've seen seem to be from the old list.

I'm sending this message to both old and new lists.  Let's see what 
happens.

If there is no automatic cross-posting, one should stay subscribed to both 
old and new lists.

They are hardly connected, really.

They're managed on separate servers, and there isn't any sort of gatewaying
between them, except insofar as one might simultaneously post to both (as
you and I have both just done).

I agree; there is not any particular value or need to unsubscribe from the
old list.

At some point, there will be a final message, hopefully an intentional
"This Is The Final Message" one, and the old list will be turned off, no
more postings allowed.  (Sorta nice if messages "bounce" in some meaningful
way as opposed to disappearing into the aether, alas, I don't imagine that
would be easy to test, particularly as there's very little maintenance
going on in the elder environment.)

Subject: [GTALUG] darktable - a rather good photo workflow for Linux
Message-ID: <5410E4B1.8020500@gmail.com>

Hi,

Don't know if there are too many photography nerds here, but I've
discovered a very nice package for managing raw photo publishing:
darktable - http://www.darktable.org/

It's not really a pixel editor like Gimp. You can add a whole variety of
transforms and filters to a group of pictures, and then export them all,
leaving the original files untouched. It works in 32 bit/pixel floating
point, so you don't get quantization issues.

darktable's UI is a little odd, and it will take you a few hours to
learn how everything works. After you learn, it works just fine.

cheers,
 Stewart

Hash: SHA1

Hi Everybodeee! Thanx for welcoming me to the ranks of GTALUG membership
last night!

As I mentioned at the meeting, there's going to be a get-together of
Free/Libre-minded software folks this Saturday afternoon.

The whole thing was started when Sergio Durigan, the organizer of
LibrePlanet-Brazil moved to Toronto and re-activated the
LibrePlanet-Ontario group, and I offered to introduce him
other Free Software groups.

LibrePlanet-Ontario -
http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:LibrePlanet_Ontario
LibrePlanet exist to promote the use of Free Software in the communities
of Ontario and to support individuals who wish to use or create Free
Software. The goals are similar to those of the Free Software
Foundation. Recently one of LibrePlanet-Brazil's organizers, Sergio
Durigan Jr. moved to Toronto and is now helping organize
LibrePlanet-Ontario. Let's show him a warm Canadian welcome!

TorontoCrypto - https://torontocrypto.org/
CryptoParty is a decentralized, global initiative to introduce the most
basic cryptography software and the fundamental concepts of their
operation to the general public. TorontoCrypto held a workshop on
computer privacy and security software in July; let's practice those new
skills by holding a GnuPG/PGP keysigning and extending the Web of Trust
to the other organizations.

Ubuntu Canada, Toronto chapter -
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/Toronto/
This weekend is the Ubuntu Global Jam, where the Ubuntu community unites
to work together to improve Ubuntu. We've got some Ubuntu DVDs to give
away; bring your laptop and try it out.

Everyone is welcome to Afternoon Tea, whether or not you're affiliated
with LibrePlanet, TorontoCrypto or Ubuntu Canada.


*What* : Afternoon Tea
*When* : Saturday, 13 September 2014 from 3:00pm to 6:00pm

And a week later we're celebrating Software Freedom Day in Kitchener.
It's an all-day event with a stream of presentations including one on
Open Data and one on Open Access publishing, a hands-on workshop on
Scratch programming and one on Privacy and Security with Tor, a film
festival, and an all-day installfest.  Everything is free, both in the
sense of Libre and Gratis. We're even giving away computers at the
installfest (monitors are $20).

Subject: [GTALUG] Serial logging: best practice, pitfalls, advice?
Message-ID: <5417ADA0.2030401@gmail.com>

Hi,

Since there are some really experienced system people here, I'd like to
ask some advice on designing logging parameters for a serial device. I'd
like to design the output log so it's most obvious to users what's
coming out the thing, and so it's easy to stuff readings into a database
for later analysis. I have complete freedom to redesign the log coming
out of this embedded device.

Here's what I get from the device:

 1. Approximately twice a minute, I get a cumulative energy reading and
    the average power for the last 30s or so
 2. About once every five minutes, I get a packet which contains an
    approximate (?1?C or so) ambient temperature

I can also report:

  * a fairly accurate (at least over the short term) elapsed time stamp
    in milliseconds - but not real time, as there is no RTC. The time
    stamp rolls over slightly more than once a month.
  * the received signal strength in dBm

This device is decoding the RF packets from the BlueLine Power Cost
Meter that the OPA and local utilities give out to hydro consumers in
Ontario. It's also the same as the Black & Decker Power Meter. The
device would allow you to track real-time energy consumption without
fiddling around with Toronto Hydro's time-of-use website (or, gulp,
having to mess with Green Button energy files - eek!). As it counts the
hydro meter's watt-hour pulses, it's pretty accurate.

So - I'm currently logging something like this

    [105874810] Energy: 63856 Wh, Power: 613 W, Temp: 14 C (Rssi -81 dBm)

where the first number's the timestamp.

  * Would this format cause hiccups in typical logging applications?
  * Is 9600 baud still the gold standard serial speed? I can use pretty
    much any speed, and there's never much data to transmit.

Any suggestions/questions greatly appreciated.

If anyone has one of these OPA Power Cost Meters, and wants to have a
play with it, you'll need:

  * a 3.3 V Arduino (or a standard 5V one and some level converters that
    can do SPI)
  * an RFM69 433.92 MHz transceiver board (caution: it uses 2 mm pin
    spacing, so won't fit a standard breadboard)
  * this code: https://github.com/CapnBry/Powermon433

The output is rough, but I've successfully tracked several days' power
use so far with far higher resolution than is available from smart meter
website.

cheers,
 Stewart

It's just a little redundant: the names end in : the values in , the 
time is in square brackets, the  rssi in round ones.

To analyze, I need to first convert the closing bracket to a , and the 
opening to a blank, and the reverse with the round brackets. Then I 
prune off the keywords, : and units.  At that point I can start the 
analysis.

I'd be more inclined toward
Timestamp: 105874810, Energy (Wh): 63856, Power (W): 613, Temp (C): 14,  
Rssi (dBm):  -81
or a linear format like
Timestamp,  Energy (Wh), Power (W), Temp (C),  Rssi (dBm)
105874810, 63856, 613,  14,  -81

If the arduino has a clock, you might also start with
*# Date and time, **Tue Sep 16 14:43:01 EDT 2014*

or if the clock was fairly good at start time, compute a date and time 
for each line from the millisecond counter and the start time.

I'd be tempted to put some kind of checksum on each record.
Communications has many ways of screwing up.

I'd encode it in ASCII graphics somehow (or even decimal) so that your
format remains readable.

I would make the logging as easy for a computer program to parse while
still making it readable.

Good point. I wonder if it's worth encoding each record as JSON, like:

{"Energy_Wh": 63856, "Temp_C": 14, "Rssi_dBm": -81, "Power_W": 613,
"Timestamp_ms": 105874810}

Readable, computer readable; maybe a little verbose, but definitely
self-describing.

It doesn't, unfortunately; also, many Arduinos use ceramic resonators,
so their clock stability is pretty terrible. I'll have to assume that
the computer it's talking to has a decent RTC, and can use the system time.

We're decoding someone else's protocol. The protocol, which a couple of
folks smarter than me reverse-engineered, does use CRC8 in its packets,
and uses multiple transmissions to get through. The transmit hardware is
quite nicely engineered: sealed case, decent Atmel transmitter hardware
with a proper loop antenna. The stock receiver uses those horrible cheap
OOK RF Radio modules, but works.

The RFM69 transceiver module I'm using as a receiver is rather nice;
built-in packet protocols, a decent on-chip buffer; even on-chip AES
encryption/decryption, should you need it.

Oh I wish the developer had done this, but most ISM band transmissions
have to be super short, as the transmitter duty cycle is really low.
Plus, every single car remote, baby alarm and automatic light switch is
chirping away on the same frequency. I'm amazed any data gets through at
all!

cheers,
 Stewart

An alternate method of doing similar selector-based tricks from a shell,
using node.js & the cheerio module:

http://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-v0-12-shell-programming-synchronous-child-process/

Note: this currently requires node.js unstable; the next stable release is
due out soon though. =)

Also, syntax highlighting in the output would likely need to be added,
perhaps using the ansi module (or similar):

Hadoop, Mongo, whatever

What would someone in Toronto expect for a Salary ?

Firstly An information architect is not a DBA.

A good DBA is normally technology specific, ie Oracle DBA, DB2 DBA, etc ...
and normally goes for $75/hr to $150/hr on contract.

An information architect not only deals with databases, data structures,
etc ... but information flow as well, ie, networking via secure or unsecure
lines, ETL rules, Application requirements, data schemas, hardware sizing
etc...

A good information architect will be going for about $150/hr.

It's almost impossible to write a non-HTML e-mail on mobile these days. I'm

Hello,

Responding to Clifford's old thread from the old list.

I have an available invitation with a few days left on it. The
invitations are time-limited (by the company, not me) so you'll have
to move quickly to use it.  iirc the basic 32GB is US$299 or the 64GB
for US$349. Accessories, like cases are $10-ish and up.

Email me, off-list, if you are interested and I know you.  :-)

I just this weekend got an invite fired my way. Phone is due to arrive tomorrow.

Do realize they ship DHL and so GST and a 10 handling fee will be COD. ~$60

I suspect I'll have invites send out before too long.

a Linux version, so the scam could conceivably work against one of "our"
