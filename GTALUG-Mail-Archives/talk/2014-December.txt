I got one of these on sale, but even now the price is $170 which is not a
bad deal at all.

The notebook, is very thin, light and surprisingly not bad, the keyboard is
not as good as on thinkpads, but could be much, much worse. Beware that
here are no PgUp, PgDown, Home, Ins, Del keys so after some remapping ALT +
Cursor keys work.
Also on top row F-keys labelled weirdly as in chromium-specific function
keys but are in fact F1-F10. POWER button is where F11 was supposed to be.
POWER key works most of the time, hard reset button is F3+POWER.
There is left `Super` key, which is something in between of Fn and 'Windows
logo' key, but it's located where 'Caps Lock' is on regular keyboard.

When I got the chromebook it was configured for an organization 'enrollment
program', it took some googling to figure out how to set that back to
regular settings. After logging in with my gmail credentials and finding
ChromeOS to be sleek but somewhat useless, I claimed my free 1TB of Google
drive storage (* Free for 2 years) and decided to install Debian, giving it
full computing resources and not messing around with crouton.

Removing ChromeOS involves undoing 7 screws on the bottom and removing BIOS
write-protect screw, then pressing Ctrl+D during boot turns chromebook into
regular laptop with SeaBios.
Wifi card is atheros-something, but it's not the best card and seems to be
a little finicky on some wireless networks, the biggest annoyance -- you
need to add a script that unloads the drivers before laptop falls asleep,
otherwise screen will lockup on wakeup. I haven't tried using bluetooth yet.
After getting rid of everything chrome-related the hardware seems to be
pretty open, this laptop might even be a new candidate computer for RMS.

I ended up with vanilla Debian Jessie and KDE (kde-plasma-netbook, which is
really stock KDE but with some netbook-specific UI tweaks).
I had to install Wheezy first as 3.16 kernel in Jessie would not boot, and
then I had to install 3.17 as it's the first linux version that supports
touchpad. Touchpad hardware is pretty awkward, but it does support
multitouch and has a middle mouse button when you press on the middle of it
with three fingers.

I needed to do lots of tweaking to get everything working, but in the end
it is a pretty sweet laptop.
If I were installing the OS from scratch again, I would have gone with
Chrubuntu.

Battery life is pretty good -- I ran about 3+ hours without
laptop-mode-tools/cpufreq-utils and 6+ hours with. At that point I still
had about 3 hours battery left, I just didn't need to run the laptop any
more.
With 20% screen brightness, powertop shows ~4W on idle, ~11W playing 720p
video off youtube (with wireless card using about ~6W).

There's 2GB of Ram soldered onto the board and not upgradable, storage
however is, it's an 16GB M.2 card. The laptop has an SD slot, but SD card
sticks about half way out so it's impractical to go with one as a permanent
storage. I'm going to upgrade to a 128GB one but M.2 is a relatively new
standard, in the US it is $12 cheaper even after currency conversion.

I checked the 4-pin aux connector that is connected to the MB and it seems 
within spec. The power supply lines aren't easy to access but I can test 
them. I wouldn't expect a failure of the power supply as I haven't had it 
long and it is one that has a wattage rating about twice that of the 
original. Power supply failures I've had in the past have usually been ones 
where the fan bearings wore out.

I have swapped the CPU for one that was supposed to be a good one and no 
change. I have built myself a simple ESR meter. After I pull the MB out of 
the case I will be able to check the caps ane see if one of them failed.

Message-ID: <CAGc8pF4sx8P4214sGmRZV78qO7+9qkkvisKxv7SfWkM2X-GoYA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using Unetbootin to do a netinstall of Debian.

It says there are no compatible kernel modules on any of the mirrors when I
try anything but Stable.

Obviously I know I can just install Stable and then do an upgrade, but
still.

What's up with this?

To install testing or unstable you have to use the development version
of the net installer.

Go here:

https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/

You could try the Beta2 jessie installer, or the weekly snapshot build
or the daily snapshot build.

According to <http://gtalug.org/> :

"GTALUG is currently looking for speakers for the 9th December, 2014 
meeting. If you are interested in speaking please contact our talks 
coordinator."

Let's brainstorm on this.  Here's a poorly organized dump of some of my 
thoughts.

- I'd love to hear Lennart talk about what he's learned working on
  routers.

- I'd like to learn what each of you has learned using Linux (or
  perhaps, not able to do using Linux) and what your current
  Linux-related interests are.

- I'd like to hear how people have set up their internet gatways.
  What's worth doing, what's easy, what's hard.
  (It's time for me to revisit this after having a pretty static
  setup for a decade.  I'd be willing to talk about what I've done
  but it is pretty stale.)

- I'm interested in setting up my in-house services like a cloud.
  Perhaps <http://owncloud.org/>.  Motivation: I want to keep control
  of my own data as much as possible.  Can anyone speak to this?

- Subproblem of above: I run MediaWiki already.  Tips and tricks (eg.
  from Drew) about care, feeding, and use would be welcome.

- I'd be willing to share 10 minutes worth of what I've learned about 
  little Windows gadgets as Linux platforms.

- I'd love to discuss whether this is interesting and useful
  <http://www.banana-pi.com/eacp_view.asp?id=64>

  This is a version of the Banana Pi with an added ethernet switch:
  5 x 1G eithernet ports.

  The Banana Pi is intended to mimic the Raspberry Pi in some ways but
  with a stronger processor; my impression has been that this is goofy
  and that the Cubieboard2 and Cubietruck <http://cubieboard.org/>
  were more transparent uses of the Allwinner chips.

  But gluing on a switch seems very attractive.

- chatting about peoples' workflow always seems useful: it's not just
  the tools, its how we use them, how we find them useful, and where
  they don't quite meet expectations.

  Examples: backup methodology, distro update methodology, favourite
  editor (leave out tribalism), programming language, etc.

- why Go is interesting <https://golang.org/>.
  Why Rust is interesting <http://www.rust-lang.org/>.
  Why Python 2.x still has a loyal following.

- what are you doing with your _____?  Example: Raspberry Pi.

- How you make your mobile device work with your desktop?

Summary: we've had Question and Answer sessions, how about an Answer
and Question session?  By that I meen: people give a mini-chat about
something they think is interesting and have the rest of us ask
questions in response.

Okay that's cool. There don't appear to be any USB images but if I recall
Unetbootin can write an ISO to USB.

Many thanks!

Hmmm, wait, could I use that to install the armhf version of Debian on my
Cubox?

DevOps - Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible in particular.

The only use I'd have for something like the Raspberry Pi is as a router
and with only one Ethernet port, that disqualifies it. The two devices
you mention above are interesting because they have multiple Ethernet
ports and would be viable replacements for my ancient and I presume
power-hungry P2/350 Compaq that has been running for the last 10 years
as my Internet gateway/firewall.

Python 2.x is still popular because many Python modules/projects haven't
been ported to Python 3.x. That's changing. Go and Rust aren't even on
my radar. Dart, maybe. Typescript seems like a safer bet. ECMAScript 6
looks very interesting. Within very few years, it will no longer be
feasible to do anything useful with a browser without Javascript
enabled. Javascript is what is enabling rich-client applications,
particularly for mobile devices.

I don't and that is something I'd like to rectify.

Finding enough time to admin a MediaWiki site to get a balance between
swatting away spammers and locking it down to unusability would get my
vote.

So, a "You're doing it wrong!" session? Nice idea.

Debian images are generally hybrid and can be dd'd to a USB stick directly

How many hours do you have?

Or Anthony could talk about all the legacy sysadmin disasters of mine

Take a good look at ikiwiki; it's a lot simpler, keeps history in git,
and you can edit pages in your favourite editor, commit them, and see
them show up formatted.

Nor I.

I had been parking at Yorkdale for the trip downtown, but then the TTC
parking there got closed for renovation shortly after our meetings moved
away from the Spadina line.  Will have to come up with a revised plan.

Maven and a Round Table Q&A Session
===================================

Maven
-----

Make was written to avoid the problem of recompiling files
that hadn't changed. It of course introduced a new set of
problems , such as verbosity, and the solutions for them.
Those solutions in turn introduced another set of problems
such as redundancy, and so on. Maven is one of the
moderately successful attempts to solve most of them.

Round Table Q&A Session
-----------------------

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from
the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to
answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a
great way to meet fellow members of our community and
discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

## Schedule

* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting (at 9:00 pm) a group of
GTALUGers move to the The Imperial Pub 54 Dundas St East
for refreshments and more socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new
ideas, improve every process every year, and foster
collaboration between individuals with differing needs,
interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek
participation from those who enhance it. This code of
conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to
mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice
that could jeopardize the participation of any person in
the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in
private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our
actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who
represents the community officially or informally, claims
affiliation, or participates directly. It applies to
activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the
GTALUG Code of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG
Board Members.

Yeah probably better that way.  Although I am sure some of it could be
very educational and entertaining.

For some reason I am still running stock firmware on my DIR-825.
Of course by forwarding ssh and http to somewhere else inside I haven't
really needed it to do anything complicated.

Well Debian's kernels are not built to run on the Cubox, so it would

TTC has a good guide to commuter parking here:
<https://www.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/Parking/index.jsp>. I have heard
good things about York Mills station (but as a pedestrian I don't have
that much information about cars).

I could happily speak to this in the future.

I'm self-hosting a bunch of stuff at home, as part of my own degooglification
process: ownCloud, SOGo, Snowy, Mediagoblin, Tiny Tiny RSS, Dokuwiki... in the
past, MythTV (including Mythweb), Mediawiki, Ampache... and services I'm
hosting, but not at home, include FreeSWITCH and ejabberd (and email...).

I also gave a talk at FSOSS this year on software freedom in a networked work,
which covered some of this as well, though not as a technical talk.

That's certainly interesting.

We had a series of talks over the years on virtualization which kind of got
boring in that it amounted to "so, how do we go through the mechanics of
setting a VM to install X"?

We had a talk on Bosh recently, which represents a newer way of going
through those mechanics.  Interesting in that it has gotten easier.
(I gather that Docker tries hard at another take on "making it easier")

The OTHER side of this is managing the infrastructure for a set of VMs.
I'm not keen on something where that's a big job; it sure would be nice if
most of the time spent managing a dozen services is spent on those
dozen services.

I know VMWare sells a product, vSphere, targeted at this, and that
OpenStack does somewhat similar (in OSS arena).  Would like to hear
more...

Most of the time this Teksaavy connection is fine, but on occasion it
slows to the point of being unusable. Can anyone suggest a program that
will log connection speed? A scrolling graph and ascii record would be
perfect.

There are lots of programs listed in response to a Google search, such as
this one:
http://dynacont.net/documentation/linux/network_monitoring/

But it would greatly help to hear what others in this group recommend.
I'm running Linux Mint.

Thanks -

for lots of "standard" thing to examine cacti is good.

Connection speed to where though?

You would have to do something that talks to a system somewhere else and
measures the current speed between those two places.  Hopefully you can
pick something where your connection locally is the slowest link and
hence the one measured.

Well, I did a "delayroute" awk script that used traceroute: a similar 
approach that turned its frequency of probing up when things fell below 
some normal value would do nicely, and tell tek where the problem was as 
seen from your site.

Subject: [GTALUG] 28" UHD monitor for $299+taxes, delivered

This is quite a bargain.  3840 x 2160 pixels!  Not a great monitor (TN, 
not IPS; 30Hz), but still perhaps useful.

Linus bought one: 
<https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/4MwQKZhGkEr>

Some think that the headline is that Linus bought it from the Microsoft 
Store.

We can buy it cheaper: US price was US$299 but ours is C$299.
