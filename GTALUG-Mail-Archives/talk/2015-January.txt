I've had ZFS, and recently now also BTRFS, tell me that it was getting
checksum errors from a disk.  In the one case it seemed like a one-off
glitch, but the other seems to be hardware that's failing by flailing,
sometimes returning whatever crap it thinks it might have seen, and in
any event its problems are widespread and that disk's being replaced
and e-wasted.

Defensively, either of those filesystems are a better thing than the
callow trusting filesystems of yesteryear.  Subtle problems you don't
notice til long later waste far too much of one's time.

At the application level, one thing that can help is keeping important
files in git (and pushing a copy to another computer!) so that you
have copies and history of revisions and it keeps checksums and will
squawk at corruption.

Another is cold-storage backups that don't overwrite existing files,
just add new ones, for things like media and other archival files
that shouldn't ever change after their initial creation.

If memory isn't completely failing me I think I recall Henry Spencer
once saying to pick them both up and buy the heavier one!

(Bigger heatsinks and beefier components certainly don't hurt.  Granted,
there are a few other factors, including efficiency if you're paying
for your own power these days and it's for a 24/7 box.)

I suppose things like rsnapshot which keeps copies with hardlinks to
save space really ought to be on a good filesystem.  By default rsync
doesn't compare files if the size and timstamp matches, which of course
means rsnapshot could happily think you have a good copy of a file but
that has in fact gotten corrupt because the underlying disk is failing.
Making it always do a read compare would make it much slower, so having
the filesystem maintain the reduncancy and checksums does seem more
efficient.

Getting reliable storage is getting complicated.

Just remember not to yell at your disks though.   They don't like that. :)

That was true before we got switching power supplies.  These days it is
way more complicated than that.

Wish it was that simple.  These days there are questions of using the
right number of caps for filterting and in the right places and the
right types, and how well distributed the voltage rails are in terms of
current at each voltage.

The benefit of rsnapshot being that unless the original or subsequent
versions are deleted, it is possible to go back in time to a version of
the file that is intact. If the underlying disk is failing and
corrupting files then ZFS or rsnapshot or tarballs won't make a
difference anyway.

FWIW, I use rsnapshot for backups on top of ZFS (on Linux) as a
production remote backup server. Apart from lengthy delete times (which
is an issue with BTRFS as well, and rsnapshot for any meaningful amount
of backups on any filesystem), it has been a reliable, and space
efficient backup system for a few years now.

Cheers, Jamon

Wow, that looks pretty awesome, though I haven't looked too closely.
They have the original Ubuntu 10 image at least so I can make sure
it's actually working. There are also files under Debian that say
'armhf' that look promising.

Thanks for this!

What am I looking at for compiling a kernel like that?

For example, I assume I have to have something already installed on
the Cubox, no? And it would have to be something newer than the
original default Ubuntu I would guess.

I installed the ubuntu image, then I used debootstrap to create a chroot
with debian, then I transfered that to be the main filesystem on the
SD card.  The only non debian part at that point is the kernel image
and modules and the boot loader.

debootstrap is a marvolous thing.

If you don't have too much on that computer, you should probably just copy
of your personal stuff and reformat it with the 14.04 version.   Nuke it
from orbit...  it's the only way to be sure.

Man, it's been so long. I don't expect you to give me a step-by-step, 
but are the broad strokes that I would make a CD or DVD on another PC, 
then boot from that to do the fresh installation?
Is there a command I can run, then at boot the installation would begin? 
I assumed I was going to lose everything anyway - I'm good about backing 
up data.

Easiest way is to download the 14.04 ISO image and then use the "Startup
Disk Creator" to create a bootable USB flash drive.  You then boot from the
USB drive and follow the instructions.

You should have everything you need on that older Ubuntu machine already,
you just need to download the disk ISO.

It sounds like it. Wow.

So can I boot into that Debian system and compile a new kernel from inside
that? And do I need to know what options to choose at compile and modules
to load for Cubox hardware or is that automatic?

Pardon my dumb questions. I was reading this, about installing Debian and
compiling a new kernel:

http://www.solid-run.com/archive/mw/index.php/Debian_netboot_installer

I might be in over my head. Those instructions assume that I know how to do
a lot of things that I do not.

Kernel config is not automatic.  That bit you have to deal with.

That's the problem when the people writing the instructions know what
they are doing already.

But ZFS would help.  If the file is corrupted by a disk, then the checksum
almost certainly will fail and the copy from an alternate disk in the
filesystem will be read and is very unlikely to be corrupted at the
same time.

I like rsnapshot too, but it is worth remembering that if your backup
of a file is ever corrupted by the disk, you won't get a new copy when
using rsnapshot/rsync in the typical mode.

OK - I'm starting in on this. Will there be any possibility of choosing 
the old GNOME interface, so I don't end up with Unity?

I use the MATE interface, a Gnome2 fork. You can install it from Ubuntu
14.04LTS "Trusty Tahr" repositories now:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/mate-desktop Install it from the
commandline with 'apt-get install mate-desktop'

I'd also install the packages 'mate-desktop-environment' and
'mate-desktop-environment-extras', but they seem to be available only
in 14.10 "Utopic Unicorn":
http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/mate-desktop-environment-extras

Instead of upgrading from 14.04LTS to 14.10 to get the
'-environment-extras' you may want to add the MATE repositories
instead. That'll let you install the '-environment-extras' package,
and probably provides you with a more current MATE core as well.
There's good instructions at
http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/download#ubuntu_1404_lts_trusty_thar

Last time I tried this (~2007), a Mac HD was recognized immediately on
attaching it to a Linux box. PPC Macs used their own slightly weird
partitioning system, but all the HFS filesystems mounted read-only
correctly. hfsutils provides a crude shell environment if you ever need
to delve into HFS images.

Your biggest problem will be the file formats. MacOS 9 was still heavily
into its data+resource fork model, so you can often be left with little
clue what type of file is on the disk, or be stuck with crazy encoding
issues. Mac Applications used to be a mess of very proprietary file
formats (Apple Works, I am glaring at you), so let's hope any data you
can get off the disk is in something vaguely sensible. And yes, formats
like Word and Excel would be considered sensible ones here ?

Old Macs use just CR for newlines, FYI.

cheers,
 Stewart

I'm after pictures and email, and can probably do a trick with strings 
to find JPEGs,  find and grep to find mailboxes and addressbooks.

Once you mount the HFS filesystem on linux you can actually get the resource fork too by doing:

ls /hfsmnt/filename
ls /hfsmnt/filename/rsrc

So if you need the resource fork, it can actually be accessed if you
know about the special /rsrc option (so essentially pretend the file is
a directory with a file inside called rsrc).

It won't show in ls that /rsrc exists since afer all the file is a file,
not a directory.

If a file has no resource fork, then you get an error if you try to
access /rsrc.

Nice.

A friend ran and Plan9 on one for years.  He's the one who ported
Plan9 to the Raspberry Pi.

(I'm not sure what "doing the DVD right now" means.)

I take it that you don't need to get them up and running again.  If
you did, I would imagine that the most straight-forward method would
be to feed the disk to a modern Mac.  They surely have migration
tools.

I'd try a PATA to USB gizmo because modern Macs don't do PATA.  If you
need to borrow one, I have one.

Subject: [GTALUG] Rogers and MTU size
Message-ID: <54A97E99.50101@rogers.com>

One thing I noticed recently was that my firewall, running Linux, was
getting a MTU of 576 bytes, instead of the normal 1500 bytes.  This was
being set by the Rogers DHCP server (option 26).  576 was common back in
the days of non-error correcting modems, but hasn't been needed since
then.  If you're running dhcpcd, you can edit
/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp and change the line 'DHCPCD_USER_OPTIONS=""'
to 'DHCPCD_USER_OPTIONS="-M"'.  This will disable the DHCP MTU setting
and use the configured MTU.

Using a 1500 MTU will improve network efficiency, as 576 bytes will
cause 3 packets to be sent, instead of 1, each with an IP header and
also causes a lot more work for all the routers along the path.  You can
verify the MTU with a ping -s 1500 <destination>.  If that works, then
you have a 1500 byte MTU along the entire path to the destination.

I found this because I was curious as to why the Ethernet port connected
to the cable modem was not getting an IPv6 link local address.  IPv6
requires a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes so, with 576, IPv6 wasn't allowed.

I have advised Rogers of this and the person I was speaking to agreed it
should be 1500.  Let's see if they fix it.

What does this pertain to? The router WAN side, router LAN side, or
client machine(s)?

My Internet connection, provided by Teksavvy, is on the Rogers cable

My router says that the address of the gateway that it's connected to
is 24.246.95.97. If I ping this address I get:

$ ping -s 1500 24.246.95.97

I am on Rogers and just checked my MTU setting after reading James' email. 
The ifconfig output reports an MTU of 1500. I didn't change any settings for 
DHCP. Rogers may have already fixed the problem.

Well, since I said Rogers DHCP, it's the MTU they assign to your
firewall, for your connection to them.

In there, I was getting only a 576 byte MTU for eth0, even though the
interface was configured for 1500.  I also wasn't getting the IPv6 link
local address.  I guess Teksavvy is providing different config for their
DHCP settings.  You can verify this with Wireshark.  You can force DHCP
negotiation with "dhcpcd eth0 -n" so you don't have to wait for it to
happen.

You'll notice the 65536 MTU on lo.  That's the maximum for IP, since
there's no MTU limit on the loopback interface.  Back when I was at IBM,
where they used token ring, I set my MTU to about 4K, as I was often
moving large files to/from local servers.

That shows you have a 1500 byte MTU, so Teksavvy is doing things
properly.  Either they're saying to use 1500 or not using option 26 at
all.  Fire up Wireshark to see.

Shouldn't matter.  If you are behind the firewall and it has only 576 to
the Internet, then path MTU discovery will force the firewall to reject
the packet and tell the computer to resize.  You can also use Wireshark
to verify the do not fragment flag is set.  As an experiment, you might
also try setting the MTU to 576 and trying that command again.

Curious. I checked before I posted my original message and it was still
576.  It may be a local issue.  I'm on the Wolfedale domain, in Mississauga.

I just tried some more testing with my notebook computer.  It uses the
KDE network manager and appears to ignore the DHCP MTU value.  However,
I can only ping with up to 1472 bytes when connected to the cable
modem.  I get the same when I tether to my smart phone (Rogers), but get
the full 1500 to a local computer on my network.  I do not use DHCP
option 26 on my DHCP server.  It also doesn't appear to be used when
tethered to my smart phone.

I assume you meant 576, not 56.

Do you see an IPv6 link local address on that interface?  It starts with
fe80.

This is similar to what I'm seeing.  When I ping your DNS, I can do so
with 1472, but not 1473 byte packets.  I also see that 1472 limit from
my notebook, but not my desktop, when going out to the Internet.  I do
not see it when pinging from my notebook to a computer on my local LAN. 
When pinging www.yahoo.com from my desktop system, I can ping with 1500
bytes.  I'm not sure why 2 computers on my network get different results
to Yahoo. Or where that 1472 limit is coming from.

One other thing, are you seeing option 26 when examining the DHCP acks
with Wireshark?  If so, what MTU size?  The capture filter I use is
"port 67 or port 68" to capture both sides of the request & ack.

That sounds like the most, uh, powerful option.  There probably would
be no need to reverse engineer MacOS9 applications' expressive but
quirky file structures.

BTW: the resource fork / data fork thing in original MacOS seems odd to
we UNIX-types who think that a file is a bucket of bytes.  But MacOS
got a lot of leverage out of that thing.  "ResEdit" was a wonder to
behold.  Essentially: the greatest common denominator for files in
MacOS was much higher than in UNIX so generic tools could do much
more.

What MacOS could do on a machine with 128k of RAM (including the video
frame buffer) puts all mainstream GUI systems to shame.  Part of this
was accomplished by using shared representations, some of which lived
in the resource fork.

That being said, I wish Linux didn't support forks.  They make the
file abstraction more complicated with very little benefit or use.
The main benefit, as I understand it, is to embrace and extend NTFS.

576 is the smallest legal MTU for IPv4.  I could imagine some system
defaulting to this in the absence of other knowledge.

In other messages you show that this is an explicit setting from Rogers' 
DHCP server.  That certainly sounds like a bad configuration at their end.

My Rogers connection has an MTU of 1500.

The normal (non-jumbo) MTU size for ethernet is 1500.

ADSL uses PPPoE encapsulation which eats 8 bytes off the MTU.

Not quite.  "ping -s 1500" on IPv4 generates a 1508-byte ICMP packet.
Plus any encapsulation that might be used (probably none with Rogers).

Elsewhere you mention PMTU discovery.  The folk wisdom (as of a few years 
ago) was that this is useless since so many routers and firewalls drop the 
necessary ICMP messages.  Sad.

| I have advised Rogers of this and the person I was speaking to agreed it

Wow.

Years ago I tried to report DHCP RFC violations to Rogers customer
support folks and got nowhere.  There seemed to be no connection
between the customer support department and the relevant engineering
department.
