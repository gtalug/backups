I've had ZFS, and recently now also BTRFS, tell me that it was getting
checksum errors from a disk.  In the one case it seemed like a one-off
glitch, but the other seems to be hardware that's failing by flailing,
sometimes returning whatever crap it thinks it might have seen, and in
any event its problems are widespread and that disk's being replaced
and e-wasted.

Defensively, either of those filesystems are a better thing than the
callow trusting filesystems of yesteryear.  Subtle problems you don't
notice til long later waste far too much of one's time.

At the application level, one thing that can help is keeping important
files in git (and pushing a copy to another computer!) so that you
have copies and history of revisions and it keeps checksums and will
squawk at corruption.

Another is cold-storage backups that don't overwrite existing files,
just add new ones, for things like media and other archival files
that shouldn't ever change after their initial creation.

If memory isn't completely failing me I think I recall Henry Spencer
once saying to pick them both up and buy the heavier one!

(Bigger heatsinks and beefier components certainly don't hurt.  Granted,
there are a few other factors, including efficiency if you're paying
for your own power these days and it's for a 24/7 box.)

I suppose things like rsnapshot which keeps copies with hardlinks to
save space really ought to be on a good filesystem.  By default rsync
doesn't compare files if the size and timstamp matches, which of course
means rsnapshot could happily think you have a good copy of a file but
that has in fact gotten corrupt because the underlying disk is failing.
Making it always do a read compare would make it much slower, so having
the filesystem maintain the reduncancy and checksums does seem more
efficient.

Getting reliable storage is getting complicated.

Just remember not to yell at your disks though.   They don't like that. :)

That was true before we got switching power supplies.  These days it is
way more complicated than that.

Wish it was that simple.  These days there are questions of using the
right number of caps for filterting and in the right places and the
right types, and how well distributed the voltage rails are in terms of
current at each voltage.

The benefit of rsnapshot being that unless the original or subsequent
versions are deleted, it is possible to go back in time to a version of
the file that is intact. If the underlying disk is failing and
corrupting files then ZFS or rsnapshot or tarballs won't make a
difference anyway.

FWIW, I use rsnapshot for backups on top of ZFS (on Linux) as a
production remote backup server. Apart from lengthy delete times (which
is an issue with BTRFS as well, and rsnapshot for any meaningful amount
of backups on any filesystem), it has been a reliable, and space
efficient backup system for a few years now.

Cheers, Jamon

Wow, that looks pretty awesome, though I haven't looked too closely.
They have the original Ubuntu 10 image at least so I can make sure
it's actually working. There are also files under Debian that say
'armhf' that look promising.

Thanks for this!

What am I looking at for compiling a kernel like that?

For example, I assume I have to have something already installed on
the Cubox, no? And it would have to be something newer than the
original default Ubuntu I would guess.

I installed the ubuntu image, then I used debootstrap to create a chroot
with debian, then I transfered that to be the main filesystem on the
SD card.  The only non debian part at that point is the kernel image
and modules and the boot loader.

debootstrap is a marvolous thing.

If you don't have too much on that computer, you should probably just copy
of your personal stuff and reformat it with the 14.04 version.   Nuke it
from orbit...  it's the only way to be sure.

Man, it's been so long. I don't expect you to give me a step-by-step, 
but are the broad strokes that I would make a CD or DVD on another PC, 
then boot from that to do the fresh installation?
Is there a command I can run, then at boot the installation would begin? 
I assumed I was going to lose everything anyway - I'm good about backing 
up data.

Easiest way is to download the 14.04 ISO image and then use the "Startup
Disk Creator" to create a bootable USB flash drive.  You then boot from the
USB drive and follow the instructions.

You should have everything you need on that older Ubuntu machine already,
you just need to download the disk ISO.

It sounds like it. Wow.

So can I boot into that Debian system and compile a new kernel from inside
that? And do I need to know what options to choose at compile and modules
to load for Cubox hardware or is that automatic?

Pardon my dumb questions. I was reading this, about installing Debian and
compiling a new kernel:

http://www.solid-run.com/archive/mw/index.php/Debian_netboot_installer

I might be in over my head. Those instructions assume that I know how to do
a lot of things that I do not.

Kernel config is not automatic.  That bit you have to deal with.

That's the problem when the people writing the instructions know what
they are doing already.
