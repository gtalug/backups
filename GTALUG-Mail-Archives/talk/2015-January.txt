I've had ZFS, and recently now also BTRFS, tell me that it was getting
checksum errors from a disk.  In the one case it seemed like a one-off
glitch, but the other seems to be hardware that's failing by flailing,
sometimes returning whatever crap it thinks it might have seen, and in
any event its problems are widespread and that disk's being replaced
and e-wasted.

Defensively, either of those filesystems are a better thing than the
callow trusting filesystems of yesteryear.  Subtle problems you don't
notice til long later waste far too much of one's time.

At the application level, one thing that can help is keeping important
files in git (and pushing a copy to another computer!) so that you
have copies and history of revisions and it keeps checksums and will
squawk at corruption.

Another is cold-storage backups that don't overwrite existing files,
just add new ones, for things like media and other archival files
that shouldn't ever change after their initial creation.

If memory isn't completely failing me I think I recall Henry Spencer
once saying to pick them both up and buy the heavier one!

(Bigger heatsinks and beefier components certainly don't hurt.  Granted,
there are a few other factors, including efficiency if you're paying
for your own power these days and it's for a 24/7 box.)

I suppose things like rsnapshot which keeps copies with hardlinks to
save space really ought to be on a good filesystem.  By default rsync
doesn't compare files if the size and timstamp matches, which of course
means rsnapshot could happily think you have a good copy of a file but
that has in fact gotten corrupt because the underlying disk is failing.
Making it always do a read compare would make it much slower, so having
the filesystem maintain the reduncancy and checksums does seem more
efficient.

Getting reliable storage is getting complicated.

Just remember not to yell at your disks though.   They don't like that. :)

That was true before we got switching power supplies.  These days it is
way more complicated than that.

Wish it was that simple.  These days there are questions of using the
right number of caps for filterting and in the right places and the
right types, and how well distributed the voltage rails are in terms of
current at each voltage.

The benefit of rsnapshot being that unless the original or subsequent
versions are deleted, it is possible to go back in time to a version of
the file that is intact. If the underlying disk is failing and
corrupting files then ZFS or rsnapshot or tarballs won't make a
difference anyway.

FWIW, I use rsnapshot for backups on top of ZFS (on Linux) as a
production remote backup server. Apart from lengthy delete times (which
is an issue with BTRFS as well, and rsnapshot for any meaningful amount
of backups on any filesystem), it has been a reliable, and space
efficient backup system for a few years now.

Cheers, Jamon

Wow, that looks pretty awesome, though I haven't looked too closely.
They have the original Ubuntu 10 image at least so I can make sure
it's actually working. There are also files under Debian that say
'armhf' that look promising.

Thanks for this!

What am I looking at for compiling a kernel like that?

For example, I assume I have to have something already installed on
the Cubox, no? And it would have to be something newer than the
original default Ubuntu I would guess.

I installed the ubuntu image, then I used debootstrap to create a chroot
with debian, then I transfered that to be the main filesystem on the
SD card.  The only non debian part at that point is the kernel image
and modules and the boot loader.

debootstrap is a marvolous thing.

If you don't have too much on that computer, you should probably just copy
of your personal stuff and reformat it with the 14.04 version.   Nuke it
from orbit...  it's the only way to be sure.

Man, it's been so long. I don't expect you to give me a step-by-step, 
but are the broad strokes that I would make a CD or DVD on another PC, 
then boot from that to do the fresh installation?
Is there a command I can run, then at boot the installation would begin? 
I assumed I was going to lose everything anyway - I'm good about backing 
up data.

Easiest way is to download the 14.04 ISO image and then use the "Startup
Disk Creator" to create a bootable USB flash drive.  You then boot from the
USB drive and follow the instructions.

You should have everything you need on that older Ubuntu machine already,
you just need to download the disk ISO.

It sounds like it. Wow.

So can I boot into that Debian system and compile a new kernel from inside
that? And do I need to know what options to choose at compile and modules
to load for Cubox hardware or is that automatic?

Pardon my dumb questions. I was reading this, about installing Debian and
compiling a new kernel:

http://www.solid-run.com/archive/mw/index.php/Debian_netboot_installer

I might be in over my head. Those instructions assume that I know how to do
a lot of things that I do not.

Kernel config is not automatic.  That bit you have to deal with.

That's the problem when the people writing the instructions know what
they are doing already.

But ZFS would help.  If the file is corrupted by a disk, then the checksum
almost certainly will fail and the copy from an alternate disk in the
filesystem will be read and is very unlikely to be corrupted at the
same time.

I like rsnapshot too, but it is worth remembering that if your backup
of a file is ever corrupted by the disk, you won't get a new copy when
using rsnapshot/rsync in the typical mode.

OK - I'm starting in on this. Will there be any possibility of choosing 
the old GNOME interface, so I don't end up with Unity?

I use the MATE interface, a Gnome2 fork. You can install it from Ubuntu
14.04LTS "Trusty Tahr" repositories now:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/mate-desktop Install it from the
commandline with 'apt-get install mate-desktop'

I'd also install the packages 'mate-desktop-environment' and
'mate-desktop-environment-extras', but they seem to be available only
in 14.10 "Utopic Unicorn":
http://packages.ubuntu.com/utopic/mate-desktop-environment-extras

Instead of upgrading from 14.04LTS to 14.10 to get the
'-environment-extras' you may want to add the MATE repositories
instead. That'll let you install the '-environment-extras' package,
and probably provides you with a more current MATE core as well.
There's good instructions at
http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/download#ubuntu_1404_lts_trusty_thar

Last time I tried this (~2007), a Mac HD was recognized immediately on
attaching it to a Linux box. PPC Macs used their own slightly weird
partitioning system, but all the HFS filesystems mounted read-only
correctly. hfsutils provides a crude shell environment if you ever need
to delve into HFS images.

Your biggest problem will be the file formats. MacOS 9 was still heavily
into its data+resource fork model, so you can often be left with little
clue what type of file is on the disk, or be stuck with crazy encoding
issues. Mac Applications used to be a mess of very proprietary file
formats (Apple Works, I am glaring at you), so let's hope any data you
can get off the disk is in something vaguely sensible. And yes, formats
like Word and Excel would be considered sensible ones here ?

Old Macs use just CR for newlines, FYI.

cheers,
 Stewart

I'm after pictures and email, and can probably do a trick with strings 
to find JPEGs,  find and grep to find mailboxes and addressbooks.

Once you mount the HFS filesystem on linux you can actually get the resource fork too by doing:

ls /hfsmnt/filename
ls /hfsmnt/filename/rsrc

So if you need the resource fork, it can actually be accessed if you
know about the special /rsrc option (so essentially pretend the file is
a directory with a file inside called rsrc).

It won't show in ls that /rsrc exists since afer all the file is a file,
not a directory.

If a file has no resource fork, then you get an error if you try to
access /rsrc.

Nice.

A friend ran and Plan9 on one for years.  He's the one who ported
Plan9 to the Raspberry Pi.

(I'm not sure what "doing the DVD right now" means.)

I take it that you don't need to get them up and running again.  If
you did, I would imagine that the most straight-forward method would
be to feed the disk to a modern Mac.  They surely have migration
tools.

I'd try a PATA to USB gizmo because modern Macs don't do PATA.  If you
need to borrow one, I have one.

Subject: [GTALUG] Rogers and MTU size
Message-ID: <54A97E99.50101@rogers.com>

One thing I noticed recently was that my firewall, running Linux, was
getting a MTU of 576 bytes, instead of the normal 1500 bytes.  This was
being set by the Rogers DHCP server (option 26).  576 was common back in
the days of non-error correcting modems, but hasn't been needed since
then.  If you're running dhcpcd, you can edit
/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp and change the line 'DHCPCD_USER_OPTIONS=""'
to 'DHCPCD_USER_OPTIONS="-M"'.  This will disable the DHCP MTU setting
and use the configured MTU.

Using a 1500 MTU will improve network efficiency, as 576 bytes will
cause 3 packets to be sent, instead of 1, each with an IP header and
also causes a lot more work for all the routers along the path.  You can
verify the MTU with a ping -s 1500 <destination>.  If that works, then
you have a 1500 byte MTU along the entire path to the destination.

I found this because I was curious as to why the Ethernet port connected
to the cable modem was not getting an IPv6 link local address.  IPv6
requires a minimum MTU of 1280 bytes so, with 576, IPv6 wasn't allowed.

I have advised Rogers of this and the person I was speaking to agreed it
should be 1500.  Let's see if they fix it.

What does this pertain to? The router WAN side, router LAN side, or
client machine(s)?

My Internet connection, provided by Teksavvy, is on the Rogers cable

My router says that the address of the gateway that it's connected to
is 24.246.95.97. If I ping this address I get:

$ ping -s 1500 24.246.95.97

I am on Rogers and just checked my MTU setting after reading James' email. 
The ifconfig output reports an MTU of 1500. I didn't change any settings for 
DHCP. Rogers may have already fixed the problem.

Well, since I said Rogers DHCP, it's the MTU they assign to your
firewall, for your connection to them.

In there, I was getting only a 576 byte MTU for eth0, even though the
interface was configured for 1500.  I also wasn't getting the IPv6 link
local address.  I guess Teksavvy is providing different config for their
DHCP settings.  You can verify this with Wireshark.  You can force DHCP
negotiation with "dhcpcd eth0 -n" so you don't have to wait for it to
happen.

You'll notice the 65536 MTU on lo.  That's the maximum for IP, since
there's no MTU limit on the loopback interface.  Back when I was at IBM,
where they used token ring, I set my MTU to about 4K, as I was often
moving large files to/from local servers.

That shows you have a 1500 byte MTU, so Teksavvy is doing things
properly.  Either they're saying to use 1500 or not using option 26 at
all.  Fire up Wireshark to see.

Shouldn't matter.  If you are behind the firewall and it has only 576 to
the Internet, then path MTU discovery will force the firewall to reject
the packet and tell the computer to resize.  You can also use Wireshark
to verify the do not fragment flag is set.  As an experiment, you might
also try setting the MTU to 576 and trying that command again.

Curious. I checked before I posted my original message and it was still
576.  It may be a local issue.  I'm on the Wolfedale domain, in Mississauga.

I just tried some more testing with my notebook computer.  It uses the
KDE network manager and appears to ignore the DHCP MTU value.  However,
I can only ping with up to 1472 bytes when connected to the cable
modem.  I get the same when I tether to my smart phone (Rogers), but get
the full 1500 to a local computer on my network.  I do not use DHCP
option 26 on my DHCP server.  It also doesn't appear to be used when
tethered to my smart phone.

I assume you meant 576, not 56.

Do you see an IPv6 link local address on that interface?  It starts with
fe80.

This is similar to what I'm seeing.  When I ping your DNS, I can do so
with 1472, but not 1473 byte packets.  I also see that 1472 limit from
my notebook, but not my desktop, when going out to the Internet.  I do
not see it when pinging from my notebook to a computer on my local LAN. 
When pinging www.yahoo.com from my desktop system, I can ping with 1500
bytes.  I'm not sure why 2 computers on my network get different results
to Yahoo. Or where that 1472 limit is coming from.

One other thing, are you seeing option 26 when examining the DHCP acks
with Wireshark?  If so, what MTU size?  The capture filter I use is
"port 67 or port 68" to capture both sides of the request & ack.

| Dave, did you receive my private message? I offered you a G4 PowerMac.

That sounds like the most, uh, powerful option.  There probably would
be no need to reverse engineer MacOS9 applications' expressive but
quirky file structures.

BTW: the resource fork / data fork thing in original MacOS seems odd to
we UNIX-types who think that a file is a bucket of bytes.  But MacOS
got a lot of leverage out of that thing.  "ResEdit" was a wonder to
behold.  Essentially: the greatest common denominator for files in
MacOS was much higher than in UNIX so generic tools could do much
more.

What MacOS could do on a machine with 128k of RAM (including the video
frame buffer) puts all mainstream GUI systems to shame.  Part of this
was accomplished by using shared representations, some of which lived
in the resource fork.

That being said, I wish Linux didn't support forks.  They make the
file abstraction more complicated with very little benefit or use.
The main benefit, as I understand it, is to embrace and extend NTFS.

576 is the smallest legal MTU for IPv4.  I could imagine some system

In other messages you show that this is an explicit setting from Rogers' 
DHCP server.  That certainly sounds like a bad configuration at their end.

My Rogers connection has an MTU of 1500.

The normal (non-jumbo) MTU size for ethernet is 1500.

ADSL uses PPPoE encapsulation which eats 8 bytes off the MTU.

Not quite.  "ping -s 1500" on IPv4 generates a 1508-byte ICMP packet.
Plus any encapsulation that might be used (probably none with Rogers).

Elsewhere you mention PMTU discovery.  The folk wisdom (as of a few years 
ago) was that this is useless since so many routers and firewalls drop the 
necessary ICMP messages.  Sad.

Wow.

Years ago I tried to report DHCP RFC violations to Rogers customer
support folks and got nowhere.  There seemed to be no connection
between the customer support department and the relevant engineering
department.

Yes, I verified option 26 was set to 576 in the DHCP acks.

I've been wondering about that too.  From my desktop computer, I can
ping Yahoo with 1500, but from my ThinkPad, only 1472.  But from that
same ThinkPad, I can ping a local computer with 1500.  I'll have to
investigate that more.

Take a look at your outgoing packets and you'll likely see the do not
fragment flag is set.  This means that if you hit a lower bandwidth link
your packets will be dropped.  So, I don't know how many are blocking
those ICMP messages.  Certainly no responsible carrier would.  Blindly
blocking them shows more ignorance than anything.  Also, since IPv6
doesn't allow fragmentation, PMTUD is mandatory with it.

I also got the brush off from the support tech, who didn't even know
what MTU was.  However, I shortly after received a survey email.  I
replied, expressing my dissatisfaction.  I then heard back from someone
who agreed that the MTU shouldn't be set to 576.  In fact, they
shouldn't be setting it at all.

I guess the best thing to do is start from the beginning and when you're
stuck you can post on the mailing list the specific problem you're having
and someone should be able to help.  (Also, you after you figure out what's
missing you could modify their wiki to either have the info you need or

I currently have residential service through TekSavvy, on the same dry loop
copper that I had Sympatico's DSL for about ten years (OK -- since it was
available in my area). I've been a customer about six months, and there
have been no surprises on the service, or on the bill. 300G monthly cap
instead of 60G, and bandwidth used after midnight (it might be between 0200
and 0800) doesn't count towards that limit. Customer service has been fine,
and my connection just works.

I would imagine business service would work as well. TekSavvy has been
smart about providing good quality service at reasonable prices, but most
importantly, decent customer service. Because people have long memories
about good service, and even better memories about poor service.

I've been using Teksavvy business DSL at work since 2010 or 2011. No problems.
Just leave some time for the initial setup, as it can take a while to get the
Bell tech scheduled to activate things (IIRC around a 7-10 business days? Maybe
less...).

My parents have been using residential Teksavvy DSL since 2009 as well. There
was one issue with signal strength in around 2011, and it took a while to
resolve, but eventually we got a Bell technician in who installed something that
boosted the signal strength or something -- it was painful waiting to get that
resolved (it was easiest to make progress via the Teksavvy forums at
dslreports.com versus multiple phone calls, but hard to do that without an
internet connection!), but that was the only time we've had a problem in 5.5
years. (We had more frequent problems with Rogers cable internet cutting out
before that TBH...)

At my apartment, I had a residential Teksavvy dry loop DSL connection from
2010-2012. When moving in 2012, since we had to pay setup costs for the new
apartment anyways, we switched to Teksavvy cable for faster speeds.


In addition to a working service, I sleep a bit better at night with less money
going to Rogers/Bell and more going to Teksavvy.

Yes 2 and 8.  And uploads don't count either as far as I recall.

And being recommended by TLUG members all the time as a result can't
hurt either.

# Social Engineering: Building A Community On Purpose with Mike Hoye

Community building in Open Source is usually "organic" - meaning
"accidental, unsupervised and messy". The bazaar has matured a lot in
the last twenty years, though, and now we know a lot about how we can
do better. Mike Hoye, Mozilla's Engineering Community Manager, would
like to tell you what works, what doesn't, and why that's important.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

## Schedule

* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub 54 Dundas St East for refreshments and more socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Customer support is there to make you happy with what you bought. 
Accepting that anything is wrong flies in the face of that mission, 
therefor support people are usually forbidden to accept bug reports.

At Honeywell, if you weren't in the right department, you had to be a 
director to file bugs. Only QA and the sales force could report bugs, 
and the latter would only do so when it sounded like it would cost money.

To this day, it's always best to report bugs to your salesperson.

My current employer has a customer outreach department, instead: they 
regularly report bugs.

| Also putting the entire OS in ROM saves an awful lot of RAM.

Lots of it was not in ROM, especially as the OS advanced and the ROM
did not.  And the ROM wasn't too large: 64K in original 128k and Fat
Macs.

(The Atari ST was a lot faster booting because more of its OS was in
ROM.  On the other hand, the OS didn't advance very quickly or very
much.  The original Amiga had almost all the OS in RAM because they
knew it wasn't yet mature.)

| Linux supports resource forks in filesystems?

I was wrong.  I was mixing up Extended Attributes (an odd thing) with
Alternate Data Streams (a different odd thing).

ADS is an NTFS feature to embrace and extend MacOS resource forks.
Apparently there is no public API for it except for backing up.  Many
google hits point out that ADS is a great way to hide things (malware,
contraband, porn) on NTFS.

Samba and Reiser support ADS to some degree (Samba: optional, Reiser
is fading away).  I don't know what API they use.

Subject: [GTALUG] war story: bad ADSL packet loss
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1501051821010.14954@redclaw.mimosa.com>

My internet connections are confusing and complicated so I will spare you 
those details.

One connection is via ADSL2 to telnetcommunications.com.  It started
to get flaky.  I measured 50-90% packet loss over various periods of
time.

I also have a VDSL2 connection with telnetcommunications.com that did
not have the problem.  Tentative conclusion:
telnetcommunications.com's network is not the problem.

I use a TP-Link TD-8816 as a modem, but not as a router.  I have a
Linux box that does the PPPoE thing.

I tried: powercycling things, one at a time, to see if things got
better.  They didn't.

I tried: phoning support.  They suggested switching phone cable or
ethernet cable before trying to talk to Bell.

I tried: switching cables.  No change.

I tried: taking other phones off phone line and removing splitter
where the ADSL modem was connected to the wall jack.  No change.

I tried: swapping ADSL modem for an identical one, purchased at the
same time.  It worked!


Lesson's learned:

- being a hoarder has its advantages (why did I buy two ADSL modems 3.5
  years ago?)

- being a hoarder has its disadvantages.  Both modems are out of (2
  year) warranty.  The splitter that came with the newly unwrapped
  modem doesn't work and I have no recourse.

- ADSL modems sometimes fail.  My previous ADSL modem (Speedstream
  something or other) failed, but I don't remember the symptoms.

- ADSL modems don't always fail hard.

- with so many pluggable parts, there is a very large number of
  configurations to test.  The modem has: power, phone, ethernet,
  all of which could have been swapped.  The wall jack needs
  a splitter, an ADSL filter on one side, and cables connecting all
  of these.  Of the right length.  And other jacks in the house need
  to be played with too.

  I didn't even bother to see if the replacement modem would work as
  well with the original modem's power supply, or vice versa.  Life's
  too short.

Any spec for a video card as to power supply wattage would be a minimum. If 
your power supply wattage is higher, no problem. You can't really know the 
power consumption of your system without measuring it. You can estimate it 
and that will give you an idea how much you are pulling from the supply.

When you add a video card to your system you don't want to be pulling 300W 
from a 300W power supply. You would like your power supply to be capable of 
more wattage than you are normally pulling from it so you don't stress the 
power supply.

| Any spec for a video card as to power supply wattage would be a minimum.

Not in my (limited) experience.  I have bought cards that wanted to
specify how big my system's power supply was because the actual
required arithmetic is too hard for customers.  They just guessed at
what the rest of my system would require and left a margin for error.

The real specs are a little tricky in theory (I don't actually know
what things are like now).  The power supply supplies various
voltages, each with its own current limit.  Each voltage is provided
on one or more "rails", each with its own limit.  But sometimes a
maximum draw on one reduces the limit on another rail.

You need a power supply that has enough oomph on each rail.  So you
want a requirement specified for each voltage.

And generally you don't know how much power the rest of your system
uses in aggregate.

Usually when you build your own system you buy more power supply
capactiy than you need.  It doesn't cost too much more and you don't
really know what's needed.

I imagine that common garden variety computers from big manufacturers
tend to size their power supplies with smaller margins.

The Atari ST was a bit of a disappointment in that it needed a disk to
boot. It didn't do much with that disk: just checked to see if it had a
boot sector, and if not, started vanilla DR GEM on top of TOS. If it
hadn't had that requirement, the OS would've booted instantly.

(I still have a tiny soft spot for Atari STs, because of the University
of Strathclyde's rather quirky approach to computer acquistion. All of
the Mechanical Engineering department ran Atari STs/ATWs* when I was
there, so much of my early lab work was done on a crisp B&W Atari
display and horrid squodgy keyboard. Hey, it was better than the CompSci
group who decided that everyone should have a Sinclair QL [68008,
multitasking, weird Microdrive floppy tape drives, hugely buggy] a few
years before. I'm sure they are still finding store rooms full of
ancient QLs in Glasgow.)

Everything after the A1000 had most of the OS in ROM, though the system
got a bit sprawling with AmigaDOS 2.0 and later. The A1000 had a
separate RAM page for the Kickstart "WOM" information, since early
versions were quite buggy. I was rather fond of the old Tripos-based
AmigaDOS, which did pretty nifty multitasking in a system with no MMU.

Since I spent so much time writing about Amigas, I sometimes toy with
getting some vintage hardware ? but then I realise I can emulate it
perfectly in my browser ?

*: Yes, we had a couple of Atari Transputer Workstations. They were very
cool, but almost impossible to program applications for.

Well the original amiga had 256KB ram dedicated to holding the "rom"
image, booted from the kickstart disk.  It certainly was treated as ROM
by the system once booted.  By the time I got an A500 they had 256KB
rom chips instead, although they hit 512KB later on.  That reminds me
I should really finish assembling my A500 bits now that I remembered
where I had the GVP-A500-HD8+.  At the moment I have managed to fit
inside an A500: VGA graphics output (1024x768x8bit colour), 68030 at 25MHz
with 32MB ram, dual ROM (1.3 and 3.1).  Closing the case got tricky.
Now I have to add the GVP SCSI controller with 8MB ram outside.  Also has
an SD card based dual floppy drive.

In fact early A3000 machines also used a kickstart image, although what
they did was run a modified rom image called 1.4, which would know how
to read the HD and was able to read the kickstart image for 2.0 from
the HD or a floppy into ram, them use the MMU to remap it and reset from
the ram image.  Once 2.04 was finished, they usually got the rom replaced
by a real one to save the 512KB of ram.

Nothing quite like the real hardware, and you can do so much crazy stuff
with it now that was way to expensive in the past.  Emulating the amiga
hardware has ben quite hard.

Subject: [GTALUG] War story: OpenWRT USB access
Message-ID: <CAEnxSC4_wy6OkHev+EVih59K0xemRNBY4wgaUzyAV3JCKa=dvQ@mail.gmail.com>

In honour of Hugh's "war stories," which I enjoy and think/hope I'm
learning from, here's one of my own about trying to get USB access on
an OpenWRT router ... and the dangers of thinking you know what you're
doing.  This is cut and pasted from my blog, so it'


I've just purchased a TP-Link wireless access point. Despite owning
the thing, the model of the item remains somewhat unclear: it's
variously known as the "TL-WDR7500," "AC1750," and the "Archer C7."
Fortunately, what was clear is that it has good specs (including
immensely more memory than the WRT54Gs I've been playing with, and two
USB2 ports), it's very well supported by OpenWRT (mine is the one with
three antennas). This is a version 2, which is also good as that has
more memory than version 1.x. And installing OpenWRT was literally as
easy as downloading
barrier_breaker/14.07/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory.bin,
logging in to the router's admin interface and then to "Firmware
Upgrade," pointing to the downloaded file, and pressing the "Upgrade"
button. It doesn't get much simpler than that.

Getting OpenWRT to talk to the two USB ports on the device was
unpleasantly difficult. With the default install, dmesgmade it clear
that the insertion of a USB device was duly noted with a log entry
like this:

usb 2-1: new high-speed USB device number 3 using ehci-platform

but there was no further information - perhaps noting whether or not
it was a drive rather than a mouse? Or what device number it was. I
started to work through the information at
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/usb.storage . So I installed:

kmod-usb-storage
kmod-scsi-core

which you'd think would be in the default squashfs file for this
specific device as they'd already included kmod-usb-core. I kind of
understand why they didn't include the filesystem types (who knows
which you're going to need?) so I installed:

kmod-fs-msdos
kmod-fs-vfat

It was possible to do insmod kmod-usb-storage and insmod kmod-fs-vfat
after these installs, but I found behaviour was better after a reboot:
I have to assume there's scripts and autodetection that set these up
better than a naked insmodcommand. Still, it's a bit annoying to have
to reboot a Linux device as if it were Windows ...

And finally I installed:

block-mount

which is apparently required to mount any device. Again, shouldn't
that be in the default image?

At this point, dmesg was acknowledging that we have genuine USB
storage devices attached:

usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-platform
usb-storage 1-1:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected
scsi0 : usb-storage 1-1:1.0
scsi 0:0:0:0: Direct-Access     USB 3.0  USB Flash Drive 1.00 PQ: 0 ANSI: 6
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] 30883840 512-byte logical blocks: (15.8 GB/14.7 GiB)
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write Protect is off
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Mode Sense: 23 00 00 00
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Write cache: disabled, read cache: disabled, doesn't
support DPO or FUA
 sda: sda1
sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk

But attempting to run mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/ fails with mount: mounting
/dev/sda1 on /mnt/ failed: Invalid argument, although we do now have a
/dev/sda1 device in the /dev/ folder and /mnt/ is a valid folder.

After hours of tests and googling, I finally stumbled across an
obscure hint from someone who was asking another question but had
"solved the USB problem" ... they had installed the appropriate NLS
("Native Language Support") packages for their area. Seriously? But
I'm willing to try anything by this point, so I installed:

kmod-nls-iso8859-1
kmod-nls-cp437

Test again, and ... I can mount USB storage devices! At least ones
with a filesystem that I've installed, so I guess I need to install
NTFS and/or ext3/4 support if I want to use hard drives.

This solution is both non-obvious and not well documented. I see in
looking back at the OpenWRT documentation that they DO mention the NLS
packages. But I didn't notice at the time and they weren't
dependencies enforced by the package manager, so they got lost. <sigh>

Some bioses (bioii?) will tell you about consumption, if that's any help.

The software package lm_sensors might be able to help you see what data is
made available but YMMV as there is no widespread "standard" for access to
power consumption data as far as I know.

Expensive servers have polished aps for acessing that sort of data....

ha! I googled "measuring  pci card power consumption" and the first hit was

"How We Measure Graphics Card Power Consumption ..."
http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/graphics-card-performance-benchmarks,3784-3.html

Very sexeh setup.

Wow.

I wonder how you could have figured this out (except via folklore).

Since it is a kernel module that is missing the nls-* modules, the
only ways of reporting the problem are: EWHATEVER return code (rather
non-specific) or logging (would have to be rate-limited).  I guess
neither of these were used.

Can you fix the web page that gave you the first hints to include the
lore about nls-*?

I've configured and built Linux kernels many times, although not in recent 
years. The reference to NLS reminded me that I saw references to NLS in 
connection with filesystem support. If I didn't include the right NLS 
support in a kernel I couldn't mount any (V)FAT/NTFS partitions. I had 
completely forgotten about this until now.

Subject: [GTALUG] Second router as wireless ethernet bridge
Message-ID: <CAGc8pF4SCbu-rNM=g1ymL0Kp6cHRRa6Kow3tfPOMA7u+Jw9QbA@mail.gmail.com>

Here's another project I'm working on that is driving me around the bend.

Sorry this is such a long story...

A computer in our basement has no wireless, so instead of running a
long cable to it, I wanted to put a router beside it and have it
connect to that router by ethernet, and then have that router connect
to the main one over wireless. No, I did not plug the computer into
the WAN port... ;-)

I have an old Linksys router WRT54GL v. 1.1 running Tomato 1.28, and
my main router, the Buffalo N600 which has DD-WRT.

According to about a hundred different howto's it should be very simple.

I set the second router to an IP outside the DHCP range of the first,
and set also set it to use the first router as gateway and DNS. I also
set the SSID and password the same, and also the type of security
used. Oh, and obviously I set the second router as 'Wireless Ethernet
Bridge'.

router 1 is 192.168.11.1, router 2 is 192.168.11.2

both have 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask

Router 1 gives out addresses starting at 192.168.11.5

Am I correct in assuming that DHCP broadcasts should be relayed by the
second router? In wireless bridge mode it doesn't appear to even have
the option of offering DHCP...

I noticed that the Buffalo will let you set up a virtual interface, so
I tried using that with no security at all.

I also found something here:

http://www.cnet.com/how-to/reuse-an-old-router-to-bridge-devices-to-your-wireless-network/

that said I should set the second router to operate as a router and
not as a gateway so I changed that.

Still no ping response from google.com :-\

The only thing I can think of is that maybe the firewall settings are
wrong on the second router, running Tomato.

Respond to ICMP is unchecked, Allow Multicast is unchecked, NAT
Loopback is set to Forwarded Only, and Enable SYN cookies is
unchecked.

Help!

Ya I will probably give it a try, unless Lennart wants to be all
magnanimous and just upload an image of his install for me ;)

Right now I am fixated on a whole wireless ethernet bridge ... thing.

Thanks for the pointer, much appreciated.

Oh, I should also say I set both routers to use the same wireless
network mode, G. Some howtos said they had to uses the same channel,
some said different channel. I have tried both. I also tried setting
the second router as gateway, not router, because of this:

http://www.cyberciti.biz/networking/howto-connect-two-wireless-router-wirelessly-bridge-with-open-source-software/

which at least was using a Tomato router so most of it had the same options.

It's very hard when there are so many conflicting instructions :-/

Subject: [GTALUG] Second router as wireless ethernet bridge

Here's another project I'm working on that is driving me around the bend.

Sorry this is such a long story...

A computer in our basement has no wireless, so instead of running a
long cable to it, I wanted to put a router beside it and have it
connect to that router by ethernet, and then have that router connect
to the main one over wireless. No, I did not plug the computer into
the WAN port... ;-)

I have an old Linksys router WRT54GL v. 1.1 running Tomato 1.28, and
my main router, the Buffalo N600 which has DD-WRT.

According to about a hundred different howto's it should be very simple.

I set the second router to an IP outside the DHCP range of the first,
and set also set it to use the first router as gateway and DNS. I also
set the SSID and password the same, and also the type of security
used. Oh, and obviously I set the second router as 'Wireless Ethernet
Bridge'.

router 1 is 192.168.11.1, router 2 is 192.168.11.2

both have 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask

Router 1 gives out addresses starting at 192.168.11.5

Am I correct in assuming that DHCP broadcasts should be relayed by the
second router? In wireless bridge mode it doesn't appear to even have
the option of offering DHCP...

I noticed that the Buffalo will let you set up a virtual interface, so
I tried using that with no security at all.

I also found something here:

http://www.cnet.com/how-to/reuse-an-old-router-to-bridge-devices-to-your-wireless-network/

that said I should set the second router to operate as a router and
not as a gateway so I changed that.

Still no ping response from google.com :-\

The only thing I can think of is that maybe the firewall settings are
wrong on the second router, running Tomato.

Respond to ICMP is unchecked, Allow Multicast is unchecked, NAT
Loopback is set to Forwarded Only, and Enable SYN cookies is
unchecked.

Help!

I don't think you understood what I am trying to do. The routers will not
be physically connected, only over wireless.

Try giving the basement computer a static IP of 192.168.11.3 with 
gateway of 192.168.11.2

Make sure that you can ping the basement router

Make sure you can access the basement router's control panel

Make sure that the basement router has a gateway of 192.168.11.1

Use Open DNS on the basement computer

Try to ping an external IP

Try to ping a domain

Sorry, wasn't thinking when I typed it. Did you try
http://lifehacker.com/how-to-extend-your-wi-fi-network-with-an-old-router-915783308

So 2nd router as as wireless repeater, the channel needs to be different
or else they would fight with each other. The SSID shouldn't be the same
as per the article. Most mobile devices supports multiple access point
profile and they will auto-connect to which ever has greater strength.

I'm pretty sure you are looking at
http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3810281

"Technically, when in client mode, your router can only pass the
incoming wireless signal to clients connected to one of the router's LAN
ports. To re-broadcast the signal wirelessly, the router would need to
be configured as a repeater?unfortunately, Tomato does not yet support
repeater mode."

http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?threads/using-tomato-as-wireless-repeater-sort-of.68322/

I don't have a tomato so I wouldn't know, but I've tested it with 2
DD-WRT, 1 in Primary Gateway (DNS+DHCP) and one acting as wireless
repeater and it works for me.

Well I have my Debian laptop connected to router 2 by ethernet as you
describe for admin and testing, so ya I can view the router web interface
and ping the router of course also.

Neither the laptop, nor the wirelessless (tm) computer can access the
internet this way.

Yes

Not sure what you mean, sorry. You mean blank, or use OpenDNS, the company?
The problem is it can't get past the router it is connected to so...

Either using gateway of .1 or .2 made no difference at all.

No DNS, nothing. I tried 8.8.8.8, host unreachable.

Thanks for replying! This is driving me bonkers...router 2 will not
communicate with router 1 and I can't see why.

Well that's exactly what I am doing though. The computer WILL be connected
to router 2 by ethernet, as it does not have wireless. If it did, I would
not have this problem.

I do not want a repeater. I want a bridge :-)

That's also why both routers must have same SSID and pass.

I remember going through this very same series of events as Giles. It 
was a few years ago with the TP-Link MR-3020, which I was setting up as 
a portable PXE boot server.

I was going through various parts of the wiki on that, but found the 
need information was covered in comprehensive document. Ah yes, this 
looks to be the one.

http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/storage

Also relevant, but assumes ext a linux-ish file systems, so doesn't 
mention VFAT or it's NLS needs.

Oh hey now that is interesting. This has given me a clue. I can look in
Wireless Survey in the Tomato interface of router 2 and see router 1.

So...that is something.

Could the problem be that router 1 is dual band? ie. it has two
SSID's, one for 2.4 and one for 5 GHz.

Oh, my gosh I am so sorry to everyone. I have been neglecting to snip
and when I went to do it the last message instead of backspace I hit
something else and sent with all the accompanying stuff that I
intended to snip.

It is not entirely my fault...top posting...and so on ;)

This is just to show that I do in fact know how to snip.

Good night for now

Couldn't let it go.

Okay so without any security enabled it works. Really really well in
fact, I'm getting full speed down here.

I will continue fiddling with it until it breaks again, of course.

The 1900AC was a rolling disaster (although this article claims it's
all sorted now, and a look at the OpenWRT documentation seems to
concur): I'd definitely take this with a grain of salt and let someone
else break the ground on it.  Linksys wanted to regain the popularity
they had with the WRT54G, but bungled both the initial release and the
price point.  Let's hope this is better.  And I admit the price is
better, the amount of memory is pretty huge and eSATA/USB3 are a nice
addition.

It's unlikely I'd be buying: I just purchased the previously mentioned
TP-Link - which is available now and known to work (which I like
better than "is promised to work," like the wrt1200ac).

If you set the second router into wireless ethernet bridge mode (not
wireless client mode), then dhcp requests should just pass through to the
dhcp server on the main router that is the wifi access point.

The second router should not have any firewall or anything like that
enabled.  It is purely a wired to wireless ethernet bridge and should
not be getting involved in the actual packets anymore.

Best news in the article is that the source for the wifi of it and the
1900ac is now available.  Yay.  I guess linksys managed to finally get
marvell to do the right thing.

For some reason some companies come up with ugly designs (The Chrysler
PT Crusier being one).  I recently had a Hitron cable modem that I
wanted to hide in the closet, it was so ugly.  I have an old WRT54G here
and it looks a lot better than the newer models.  I guess the designers
are watching too much sci-fi.  ;-)

As much as I support open source, I wouldn't give these devices shelf space.

Not every device supports this mode though: you need to be able to use
4-address framing at the wireless level, so that the source address on
the ethernet segment is preserved (see:
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode)

If you happen to have ath9k on board, you can use 802.11s for this
kind of thing: run both a mesh and AP interface on each access point
and join them with the mesh interface.  Then, your clients can connect
to either AP and even roam between them based on RSSI or whatever.
11s is designed to make all the participants look like they are on the
same LAN so DHCP etc. will work across it and you don't have to run
separate IP networks.

(I work on 802.11s in Linux.)

Embarrassingly, I understand very little of that...however, it is
working. The computer has internet, and everyone can see each other on
the network. The only limitation is security. It only works with WPA
and AES, no WPA2 or TKIP enabled on either router. I suppose my neck
is exposed security wise?

I never needed anyone to connect wirelessly to the second router. The
signal from the main router, the Buffalo N600, is amazing, it covers
the entire house. Actually, as I understood it, the second router
would not even be offering wireless connectivity to devices in
Wireless Bridge Mode.

Hi all,

Has anyone worked in a coworking space? Have a favourite?

I'm just starting my search online, and from what I see, there are plenty
to choose from. Any anecdotal tales would be really helpful. I'm completely
new to this. Thanks!

I live by the Main St subway stop, but have a slight preference for more
centrally located locations, because the company I work for might start
hiring in the Toronto area in the near future.

Thanks,
Greg

WPA/AES-CCMP should be OK for most purposes.

Honestly I'm not really sure what Tomato is doing for "Wireless bridge
mode," a quick google didn't turn up an answer.  It would be
interesting to see some wireless frame captures from the setup.  If
it's doing some WDS 4-address mode, then that's great.  If not, you
may have some problems reaching some machines behind the client
router.

Sounds like "Wireless client mode" is running two different IP
networks and routing at layer 3 between them (i.e. the network behind
the client router would be on its own subnet compared from the AP
network).  This mode will work with any AP.

Yes, this is something 'extra' that mesh could offer (if you wanted --
you can also just bridge the wireless traffic onto an ethernet LAN
like you are doing, without running a second AP).  Mesh also has some
better encryption facilities built in.  But, I'd say having an AP that
supports mesh is highly unlikely unless you put openwrt on it yourself
and the hardware is Atheros-based.

Are you wanting to use a second router because you already had one on hand? 
I would have thought it a lot easier to just pick up another WiFi adapter 
for the machine in the basement.

Of course, yes. Also, this will let me connect a few more devices
should the need ever arise. I keep thinking our home is at the
saturation point for devices, but, you know...

This old Linksys has been very very useful on a number of occasions.
When we go on family trips we sometimes bring the Playstation for
rainy days and I can even access PSN and Netflix on hotel networks
that try and block it.

Funny you should say that. The one computer I wanted to connect using
the bridge is running Windows 7 Home Premium. It's strictly for Steam
games that just won't run well under emulation and so on. Anyhow, like
all Windows machines I've ever used, it is an absolute nightmare as
far as networking. Even when it was connected directly to the primary
network by an ethernet cable it would not let me access any SMB shares
or access my Chromecast. It still won't. Of course every other device
or computer, running Mac, Linux, Android or iOS will see and access
the shares just fine, over wireless or ethernet.

I actually tried using WDS to no avail. Now that I know the security
mode may have been the hindrance I might give that a try again. Maybe
Windows will like that better. I'm not holding my breath.

Ya I kinda like it the way it is. The less Windows can access my
network the less harm it can do. It is good for modding and playing
Fallout, that's it :-)

I'm curious tho, how would I bridge wireless to ethernet without a
second router? Wouldn't I need some sort of separate device?

Sorry for the confusion, I meant "AP" as in the access point service,
not the AP/wireless hardware itself, which, of course, you would need.

A proper backup system should not have left you with issues in your 
Thunderbird filters unless the recovery process copied the Thunderbird files 
on to a machine with a slightly different path to the directory containing 
the mail files. Running in to a case where something didn't work right (in 
this case the filters) makes you take a second look at the backup procedure 
to make sure something wasn't missed in the process.

Yes, it is a bit more complicated an issue than I may have made it out to be 
but I didn't want to overwhelm the person asking the question with too many 
details. There are websites online that let you estimate the power 
consumption of a computer based on what is inside the box. Even those can be 
based more on typical values for different items rather and may still not 
represent the actual power requirements for the items in ones own computer case.

I am giving it a go at the moment when I have a bit of spare time.

I now have the debian jessie 3.16 kernel running on the cubox.  It needed
two small patches from the upstream kernel to fix a couple of tiny
problems, and then I enabled about 8 missing config entries in the debian
kernel.  With that and adding the CuBox to the flash-kernel package,
I can now install a kernel and have it configure u-boot automatically
the debian way.

No graphics support yet, but I am testing a build with some patches
pulled from Russell King's tree that might solve that.  It even includes
support for using the marvell binary video decoder libraries with the
video decoder hardware in the CPU, so perhaps that would be useful
for something.

So pretty soon I should be able to have a nice clean Jessie install
of Debian with only a slightly modified debian kernel package matching
exactly what Jessie expects (I was running a 3.8 kernel before).

So far USB, uSD and SATA as well as the IR port are working with the
Jessie kernel no problem.

There's also a chance that the restore went fine, but Thunderbird isn't
looking at the right profile, so doesn't see it. Profiles are yet
another annoying feature of Thunderbird (and still I use it; partly
because everything else has more or different annoyances).

Maybe there's something in this page about profiles that might fix the
issue: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Profile_folder_-_Thunderbird

Weren't you going to use yours for video playback as part of whole home

I tried out the daily snapshot yesterday and it is AMAZING. The installer
failed a couple of times I think because some mirrors were missing stuff
for LXDE so I just did the default and it finished in 10 minutes.

Jessie is really nice. Everything on the Asus netbook worked perfectly,
wireless, touchpad, and so on. Very very slick release. I can't even
imagine what the advantage there is in choosing Ubuntu anymore.

I wanted to confirm Scott's implied thesis, so I installed and
uninstalled packages to do a few tests: the NLS files are required for
vfat filesystems, but NOT for ext4 or iso9660 filesystems.  So an
appropriate kmod-nls-* should be a dependency for the kmod-fs-vfat
package but not for USB storage in general.  But I don't think (didn't
research this part) opkg supports virtual dependencies, and forcing a
download of all NLS packages wouldn't work ...  Okay, it _might_ work,
but these are low-resource devices: it might also exhaust all space on
the storage media.  So it's a pretty thorny problem.

Ubuntu was always better equipped in the bugginess department. :)

That was my plan, but it turns out the video decoding and such are not
open source and not standard.  Rather unfortunate, because by spec it
is perfect for the job.  There exist gstreamer and xmbc support for the
marvell ipp libraries for the video decoding, but not sure mythtv can
use it.  Most likely the CuBox-i would be much easier to get working.

Well it's getting there.

FYI, there's now a Kickstarter project for the OneRNG entropy generator.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbaseotago/onerng-an-open-source-entropy-generator

You can request quantity-of-one for $50 NZD (which is about $46 CDN), or
get 5 for $200 NZD.  $90 NZD premium for a hardware programmer.  (It's
consciously NOT programmable across the USB interface for safety sake.)

Also quite worthwhile to visit the 'design' site <http://onerng.info/>,
which points to both software and hardware 'source code' on GitHub and
design materials

This is a more open platform than Google Maps.  Much more in the
spirit of GTALUG.

If you think something is missing, just add it!

I don't see any "get directions" capability, like Google Maps has.

And what about street view? I like to familiarise myself with
landmarks that I'll be seeing as I approach my destination. It cuts
down on distractions, like hunting for address numbers, etc,

There's no reason both links couldn't be included, though.

While the OSM database structure is capable of doing routing, it's not
hosted on the main server. OSM runs on a tiny budget.

Routing data is only as good as the data in OSM, and there are a whole
bunch of users who do nothing but fix local routing errors. I don't
think you've seen nerdy until you find out some of the very specialised
things that OSM mappers do for fun.

> And what about street view?

Sheesh; picky-picky. There are a few street view sites associated with
OSM; http://openstreetview.org/ is the first I found. No pictures? Add
'em. You have a phone camera and no excuse.

Richard W will likely be along with better suggestions, if we can get
him away from recreating the Industrial Revolution in his condo ?

cheers,
 Stewart

Great, that's really going to help those who are looking for how to
get to GTALUG meetings, which I believe is the reason that a map link
is included on the web site.

> No pictures? Add 'em. You have a phone camera and no excuse.

I don't have a camera in my phone
<http://www.cellphones.ca/cell-phones/nokia-3155i-rock-box/>
Plus, if I have to travel to my destination to take pictures of
landmarks, to make it easier to find my way there, what's the point?

Again, I propose that links to both Google Maps and OSM be included.
Let the user decide if they want a pure open source experience, and/or
perhaps a more useful one. The more information, the better.

I don't want this to turn into a flamewar so first thing is as the
person who sends out the announced emails I will include both Google
Maps and OSM links in the emails.

Personally I feel even though Google Maps software or mapping data is
not open source it's at least accessible from a pretty much every
modern browser and more importantly accessible for people with visual
and reading disorders (i.e. dyslexia).

# Social Engineering: Building A Community On Purpose with Mike Hoye

Community building in Open Source is usually "organic" - meaning
"accidental, unsupervised and messy". The bazaar has matured a lot in
the last twenty years, though, and now we know a lot about how we can
do better. Mike Hoye, Mozilla's Engineering Community Manager, would
like to tell you what works, what doesn't, and why that's important.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub 54 Dundas St East for refreshments and more socializing.

Code of Conduct
===============

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members.

Perhaps when the weather allows t-shirts and shorts again we can organize a mapping party. I haven't done that in ages.

It is told that to the ancients, a "map" was a folded-up paper thing
depicting the roads one might use to get to one's destination, and
the routing algorithms were advanced-for-the-time neurochemical things
that ran directly in the user's brain, there being no CPUs or Internet
connectivity or cellular data yet.

And yet I found my way to meetings, back when this was called TLUG,
both ways uphill in the snow.  But if you tell kids nowadays, they
won't believe a word of it.

When I were a lad, we didn't have Linux, but we started a Linux user group
anyway as an aspirational cargo cult ...

(Back in GLUG [Glasgow Linux User Group, c.1995-6] days, we always held
meetings in pubs. We found our way there no bother, but strangely, it was
always far slower and longer to get home. I wonder why?)

Before there was Linux (I know, the dark ages), I remember consulting thick
books, given away free, that were an alphabetical listing all of the people
and businesses in a given area, along with their addresses and phone
numbers. I probably used that technology to get to my first meeting of the
Toronto PC User's Group, held at a school near Bayview and York Mills in
the late 80's.

Good times!

Snow, ach!  After the landslide buried the village we had to push our
way through gravel a hundred and fifty foot deep!  There and back, every
day!  AND fight off the Mole-men.

Thanks.

It was very good live (last night) so I thought I'd take a look at this.

First impression: really distracting that the right channel is a
delayed echo of the left channel.

That's probably a property of the space.

also: the recorded talk is better than the talk he gave (IMHO)

He never said "jack ass" in our talk, and the whole commoditising
leadership is a great idea that he didn't mention in our talk.
