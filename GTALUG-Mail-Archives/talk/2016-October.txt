Hi Bill: This is sad news. I've mentioned EnterpriseLibre at a couple
of user groups I participate in, and had hoped the project would be
better recognized that it is.

I'm forwarding your message to the Free Software mailing lists I
subscribe to. Perhaps this will generate a bit of interest.

--Bob.

I'm thinking about taking public transit to FSOSS2016.  I can get to
Go Union Station easy.  From there, Trip planner says
    - Union -> University Subway line -> Downsview -> York U
    - Union -> Yonge Subway line -> Finch -> York U

For those living (and taking TTC) in Toronto, which route is least

Take the University subway. The Finch bus is a long ride.

Not necessarily, especially if you're coming from the east end. There is now the 199B Finch Rocket that goes express from Scarborough Centre, via Finch Station, right into to York. West of Dufferin it uses reserved bus lanes.

1. Evan is an expert since he has lived at York.
   Is it really faster from Finch than Downsview?

2. The question was about crowding, not speed.

3. I would recommend going through Downsview based on little
   information

4. There might be a difference between going to York and returning.
   The bus queues for the return trip have seemed horrible.
   There is apparently a trick: catch them inbound, a stop before
   everyone else.  I haven't tried this

5. On Scott's advice, I've taken the rocket from the Sheppard station.
   Perhaps Finch would have been better, perhaps not.

6  This year my starting point is different (St. George station) so
   I'll probably go through Downsview

​It all depends on where you're coming from.

>From east of Yonge and north of St. Clair it's probably easier to;

- Take the Sheppard subway to Sheppard/Yonge and take the 196B from there.

or

- Take the Finch 199B from Finch Station, Scarborough Centre or major
intersections in between

If you're coming from downtown or are close to the Bloor line take the 196
from Downsview.

>From west of Jane, take the 195 Jane Rocket from Jane Station or major
intersections.

(And of course there are GO buses direct to York from Square One, Richmond
Hill, Oasville, Oshawa etc.)

Having said that, this is 2016. Download a bloody Android app to tell you
the fastest way to York from wherever you are. Google Maps does a workable
job but there are some specialized apps that track the TTC bus GPS signals
(I prefer the "Transit" app that also works in other cities).

2. The question was about crowding, not speed.
>

​Into campus​, buses will probably be crowded but there are lots of them.
Rush frequencies on the 196 from Downsview will be less than every five
minutes and they use the double-length buses on that route.

​This will guarantee you a seat but will probably make your journey slower.
Works with the 196 (which stops in front of Seneca in the afternoon before
going to the main loop)​ and the 106 (non express bus to downsview --
slower but less crowded).



> 5. On Scott's advice, I've taken the rocket from the Sheppard station.

​Of the two, the 199B from Finch will probably be faster from Yonge Street​
since it has no significant north-south travel. If starting from Yonge and
Sheppard take the bus direct from there.


> 6  This year my starting point is different (St. George station) so

​Absolutely​.

​Note: This will be the last year this info will be relevant (except for
the advice to use an app.) This time next year the subway will run directly
to York.​

This is a no brainer.

Take the subway to Downsview. The Yonge line is busier.

Catch the York University Rocket bus, 196, to the University. It only 
makes two stops, and travels along bus right of ways. Very fast.

Just do not take the Rocket bus that goes east to Sheppard. I think it 
is the 196B, but not sure.

One point that seems to be missing is where the OP is coming from.  If
Mississauga, there are GO buses from Square One right to York.  No idea
of the schedule though.

We are still looking for an Election Officer, it should only take 30
minutes of your time on 11 October 2016 and is incredibly important to
the GTALUG organisation.

Well during rush hour, the viva orange runs from downsview to york
univerisity, and TTC fare (pass or transfer) is valid for that trip.
Not sure how the return trip would work unless you have a TTC pass since
they wouldn't sell you a TTC ticket and transfer of course (the viva
bus doesn't sell fares at all after all).  I think the TTC 196 rocket
runs a similar connection and seems to be more frequent.  Probably
simpler.

I can't imagine trying to go over from the yonge side would make any
sense unless the 60 express to york makes better progress that I could
imagine doing on steeles during rush hour.

I went with this product as it has a number of signal inputs. Also
available on the net is a usb EPROM flash tool, but I'm hoping to
override/modify EDID data in X in order to test several closely related
LCDs with the same cable.

M.NT68676.2A(HDMI+DVI+VGA+Audio) LCD/LED Screen Controller Board Diy
Monitor Kit

The cost was $61, and some change. It took about six weeks to ship. I got
the full kit with power adapter rather than trying to recycle the PS and
backlight inverter from the tickle trunk.

Time to dig out the multimeter.

The general instructions are to power test the inverter first, then test
that the cable ground from screen to adapter is correct.

Here's a shot of the package contents as delivered to my standard apartment
sized mailbox.

Very nice braid on the FPDL cable, I couldn't do that without a lot of
practice. There is no spec sheet with the package so I'm going to turn to
the net to figure out the EDID pairs.

Success or failure some time soon, but It wouldn't be the the first time I
toasted my pet project.

I found a Kingston kns1650r sitting at the side of the road (Bloor 
St.) today.

I have no need for it (I only use gigabit networking these days) but it 
seems like a waste to throw it away.

I've not tested this.  It might have capacitor rot, for example.

It is configurable, but with a hard to find old Windows program (circa 
2000).  But I don't imagine that configuring is useful.

I can bring it to next week's meeting.

Does anyone use an email client that has decent autocorrect? I am a
terrible typist who makes many similar mistakes over and over. In
thunderbird, correcting my errors takes about 30-50% of my total message
composition time. I know there are reasons to hate autocorrect, but in my
case it's a big timesaver. Any suggestions?

Thank you!

You could possibly try voice to text it can't be any worse than the 
auto-completion on my android where on some messages I can spend %60 to 
70% my message time trying to get it to let me put in what I want.

I think your looking for auto-completion.

take a look at:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/text-complete/

I guess mutt+ispell is not what you have in mind.

I use Vim's spell feature, and Vim is called by Mutt.  When I type wrong

I am also a trrible typist and on top of it a horrible speller. There
was a great plugin for Thunderbird[0] but i hasn't been updated since
31. So now I just have the *Check spelling before sending* option
checked. It should be in Options -> Composition -> Spelling.

On a somewhat related note there are also some good command line
utilities I like to use:

* Bash's Shopt cdspell[1] will fix mistakes like `cd /etc/psotfix`
automagically.
* thefuck[1] correct the previous command like `aptget install python`
to `apt-get install python`.

It'd be interesting to see what an open monitoring network might
reveal.  Here's a Raspberry Pi - Stingray Detector that uses a
Raspberry Pi along with a SIM 900 module to monitor local cell towers:

Since I have not yet heard any compelling suggestions from the list as to where I should sup, I intend to visit King Place.  King Place is at the southwest corner of Dundas & Sherbourne, and has both tasty Pakistani food and plenty of seating.

understanding on a topic rather not doing a talk until we feel like experts.

Interesting...

I'll observe that Postgres development is being handled in quite similar
ways, down to having a surprisingly similar tool to LK "patchwork"

Subject: [GTALUG] Hiring Someone to do a Custom Ubuntu Spins
Message-ID: <CAFMwaAvDM-xixr74wv2Wt9QLvNRPy1W2GHxzHGwRKKEKKEgZzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm involved in a start-up which has developed software to run on Ubuntu
Linux [1].  We're currently looking to sell "appliance" servers with the
software pre-installed.  We want to streamline the installation process by
building a custom install ISO which uses our required partitioning scheme
and installs some additional drivers and software that are not available on
the base image.

We'd like to hire someone on a contract basis to do this for us.
Primarily, we just need someone who can work through the steps here:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization based on our
requirements.  Minimal requirements include having the installer:
 - Partition drives in a particular configuration
 - Install specific required packages
 - Install NVIDIA and CUDA drivers
 - Create a special user and execution of a scripts to install software as
that user.

If you're interested or have any questions feel free to send me an email
with your CV and some idea of what your rates might be.

Cheers,
Marcus

Subject: [GTALUG] War Story: installing Fedora 24 on an old Acer Aspire
	9300-3089
Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.2.20.1610131651410.21578@redeye.mimosa.com>

TL;DR:

- if booting hangs, remove "quiet" and "rhgb" from the kernel command.
  This will show you the boot log in realtime.

- if a module is causing the hang, you can suppress it with 
  "modprobe.blacklist=modulename"


We needed a computer for casual use at a remote location.  So we pulled 
one out of retirement.

Boring first task / adventure: back up all the precious files.  It was 
dual boot Ubuntu 12.04 / Windows Vista.  Vista had suffered some kind of 
bit rot: svchost (or some name like that) was eating 100% CPU so that it 
was impossible to do backup from it.  Not a virus.  I wasted a lot of time 
trying to cure the problem but so many Vista tools have disappeared that I 
didn't get anywhere.  We'll do backing up of the Windows filesystem from 
Linux at some later date.

I replaced the 120G HDD with a 128G SSD that I bought yesterday for $40 
from The Source.  Boy those are getting cheap.  I did *not* copy the old 
disk to the new one.

I then tried to install Fedora 24 "Workstation" using a USB stick.  It 
hung part way through the balloon in the startup screen.  How I diagnosed 
and dealt with this is the real subject of this War Story.

- I rebooted the stick, selecting "check installation medium".  Checking 
  succeeded but the installation hung the same way

- rebooting from the stick, I hit "tab" on the menu item for installing.  
  This lets you edit the kernel parameters.  I removed "quiet" and "RHGB".
  This puts a boot log on the screen instead of the splash screen.

- thet boot stopped making progress when "acer_wmi" was started.  This is 
  a module intended to do things with Acer's ACPI stuff for wireless (I 
  think).  I guess my notebook is too old to match this module's 
  expectations.  The machine has hung but I've learned what's important.

- I reboot again, hitting tab again, removing "quiet" and "rhgb" again.  
  And I add "modprobe.blacklist=acer_wmi".  This magic incantation solves 
  the problem and I can complete the installation.  Apparently this also 
  sets up /etc/modprobe.d correctly so that the installed system
  will work too.  I discovered the incantation in the Fedora 24 
  Installation Guide section 8.2.3.

  The required parameter was "rdblacklist" in Fedora 16 days so perhaps it 
  is different in your distro of choice too.

I don't know how closely your application is tied to Ubuntu. One option you 
have would be to look at rolling your own ISO using Morphix. I've used it 
before to create a bootable USB key with the software needed to run a kiosk.

I'm not really sure if this is a solution but if all of your hardware
is the same across your devices, you could simply use "dd" to create a
base image from your first working device and then after copying
update the files that need to be different between the machines (the
primary one being the SSH keys).  That's what I did when I had to
install the same OS and software across 100 machines.

Message-ID: <CAGxYWpZvZo-1ht9svmCFjxMdp3Sbj0V4XBfW3zRcKoNXJ7WqXA@mail.gmail.com>

On the off chance anyone else is using Ubuntu 16.04 ...

This morning I found my computer barely usable because of a kernel
update yesterday.  My screen resolution was reduced to the minimum,
mouse and track pad didn't work, and no wifi.  After some searching
online, I found that the issue was the update failed to install the
"extra" package.

You can check if this is your problem by running ` dpkg --list
"*4.4.0-43*" ` and seeing if you're missing the "linux-image-extra"
package.  If so, then you can run "sudo apt-get install
linux-image-extra-4.4.0-43-generic" to fix it.

Why not just use the official preseed with custom iso option:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization

Writing a pressed file that does the partitioning and installs extra
packages is not hard.

Umm, I'm top posting this because I think there is some misunderstanding
about the nature of the original post.

This is a contract offer for tender. While most of us do lots of different
things related to Linux and roll our own solutions, the OP is looking for a
special skill set they don't seem to have in house, so to speak.

Having done a Red Hat net kick-start floppy, through peek and poke, some
sixteen years ago, I know the basics can be done fairly simply.

I believe the OP is looking for someone to write scripts to handle the
installation of special partitioning and specialized hardware and software.

Python / Pearl and HW troubleshooting knowledge would come in handy for
hardening a commercial product like the one described.

Since this is an appliance, the biggest obstacle I see is the appliance
form factor uniformity. You don't want the ISO installer to choke on a
slight firmware or other issue.

Hi,

I'm involved in a start-up which has developed software to run on Ubuntu
Linux [1].  We're currently looking to sell "appliance" servers with the
software pre-installed.  We want to streamline the installation process by
building a custom install ISO which uses our required partitioning scheme
and installs some additional drivers and software that are not available on
the base image.

We'd like to hire someone on a contract basis to do this for us.
Primarily, we just need someone who can work through the steps here:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization based on our
requirements.  Minimal requirements include having the installer:
 - Partition drives in a particular configuration
 - Install specific required packages
 - Install NVIDIA and CUDA drivers
 - Create a special user and execution of a scripts to install software as
that user.

If you're interested or have any questions feel free to send me an email
with your CV and some idea of what your rates might be.

Cheers,
Marcus

I have the same problem after the update. :(

Just screen resolution, though. Mouse fine.

I do have the package installed :( :(

I tried upgrading to 16.10. No joy :( :( :( :(

Subject: [GTALUG] Screen Resolution Problem with Ubuntu
Message-ID: <378c8377-16f1-400f-fee5-7af5c0b576ae@rogers.com>

I have an H97M-E MB with on board Intel video chips.

I have a high def ASUS monitor.

I connect through a KVM switch, the video being VGA

For a long time I have had no trouble with 1920x1080 resolution.

Things started getting flaky in the spring. An OS update prevented 
Ubuntu system tools from recognizing the monitor and the highest res was 
1024x768.

I decided to upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 hoping that would fix. It did 
not and there was a lot of pain in the upgrade.

I finally found I could fix using xrandr.

Last week Ubuntu issued another OS update and it again caused the 
monitor to not be recognized and the max resolution to be 1024x768.

I ensured the full update was performed as discussed in recent email to 
this group.

I upgraded to 16.10. No pain but no joy.

I explored further with xrandr:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xrandr

I used

cvt

I got: Modeline "1920x1080_60.00" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 
1088 1120 -hsync +vsync

xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 
1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
xrandr --addmode 1920x1080_60.00

After the last commend, my screen resolution was reduced to something 
like 640x480 and an error window popped up. I could not read the full 
error message because it was off the screen. It started with "Could not set"

I had to do a system reset.

So still no joy. Still stuck at 1024x768.

I posted to the Ubuntu forums. No response yet.

Any and all suggestions welcome and appreciated.

Thank you!!!!!!!!

I looked at the script and just thought it would just detect and report.

But it set to 1920x1080. It was a flaky screen. I rebooted, and the 
setting was persistent and I have JOY!

And I am saving that script! :)

But thanks to Russell I have joy.

What screen resolutions are available to switch to?  Perhaps the
driver for your video card isn't properly installed or working?

You could try going to Settings > Software & Updates > Additional
Drivers and checking if there's a driver for your video card that's
not currently being used.

Ah.. I just saw your other posts...  I see you fixed it.

My issue wasn't when I upgraded to 16.04.  It was while on 16.04 it
did a small kernel update and neglected to include the "extras"
package related to that new kernel.

I haven't tested the display adapter I ordered yet but I thought the links
here might be of general interest.

No pun intended, but it's always nice to be able to have a default
resolution for a display problem.

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/EDID/HOWTO.txt

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid_load.c

I came across these while looking for more info on HDMI. With so many
different display connection types and so many different Flat Panel
Displays, it's good to know where and how to take control, without
resorting to turning off kernel modeset at runtime.

Hi Marcus,

I've done exactly that for Ubuntu before (and am still doing it now). Are
you still looking for someone to do that?

I've been using GNOME for a long time and am used to it, but the desktop
search functionality is pretty limited. In my current installation it
doesn't seem like tracker is integrated into the "windows" key search --
but from what I read it's supposed to be. I'm about to get a new computer
and am planning to do an incremental migration where I try to fix some of
hte problems in my current setup. I wondered -- does anyone have tips for
getting search set up in an effective way? Thanks so much as usual,
Matt

Subject: [GTALUG] VirtualBox Guest Additions in Ubuntu VM doesn't work
Message-ID: <20161020100404.GA15715@node1.localdomain>

Question for Ubuntu users...

VirtualBox Guest Additions installed by default on Ubuntu/Kubuntu VM is
5.0.18, ie.
    modinfo vboxsf
    
Now, when I try to upgrade to latest 5.1.8, the install script
(VBoxLinuxAdditions.run inside VBoxGuestAdditions.iso) finishes OK, but
the version is still 5.0.18.  Looking at kernel drivers, it seems that I
have 2 versions of drivers:
    kernel/ubuntu/vbox/...	--> from Ubuntu kernel
    misc/...			--> newly compiled

When I removed the default kernel drivers, then it uses the newly
compiled 5.1.8 drivers. (which is what I want)

What is Ubuntu-way of removing kernel drivers, or specifying which
driver should be loaded?

I don't particularly use Ubuntu but here's a link to automatically
sortinging things after a kernel update.

Make sure dkms is the latest version...

http://askubuntu.com/questions/408605/what-does-dkms-do-how-do-i-use-it

If you don't update your kernel all that often and don't want to use dkms,
so as to stay completely repo based, it's best to uninstall/purge with apt.
Do this before you upgrade  previously installed applications that use
modules which are not included in your stock kernel.

Or you can try this after each kernel update.

sudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-{whatever version}.

Hope this helps.

I'm in the same boat with Ubuntu. Tracker - or an equivalent - *used* to
be set up. I'd say about 2-3 years ago, desktop search on my machine was
comparable to Windows or Mac OS Spotlight: hit the hotkey, start typing,
and files containing your search term would appear. Now, at best I get
files with the search term *in the filename only*.

This is NBG. I have lots of files, and I'm a fairly messy person. A big
heap of files with searchable contents *should* be indexed, and not by me.

cheers,
 Stewart

Yeah,. It's lamentable.  I can't even find decent documentation for how to
set it up oneself. I don't understand why that would have disappeared too.

See if you can find a config that controls it: it may have been 
defaulted to off, as it can be an expensive operation for someone who 
never uses it.

Setting the default to off is exactly what a UX designer might do.

Given that Linux is a developer/sysadmin do-ocracy*, I'd be surprised if
there are any UX folks involved. Filesystem indexing chews disk space
and CPU, so I can easily some maintainer going eek and turning
everything useful off.

User-focused commercial OSes enable desktop search by default, so I
guess this just isn't the year of Linux On The Desktop yet … (a tired
joke since at least 2001). Jef Raskin produced systems in the 1980s
(SwyftWare, 1983; Canon CAT, 1987) with "Leap Keys" to do the equivalent
of desktop search. So this is hardly a cutting-edge need.

My last experience with installing search daemons on Ubuntu was not
good. One would silently fail if it found UTF-8 text. Another was
clearly maintained by someone with either a much smaller or much faster
system than me, as it ran cron jobs at very high priority that never
finished before the next update was triggered. Basically meant my
machine ran like molasses after an hour and needed the indexer processes
killed.

cheers,
 Stewart

Top posting again.
It all works. The recycled laptop screen is connected to the Pi through the
M.NT68676.2A display adapter.

The provisional instructions said to make sure the ground on the LVDS cable
was connected to the adapter correctly or damage to the screen would
result. The original Toshiba cable was tabbed on top so it could only
connect in the correct orientation. In fact the pin offset on the
connection ensures that the cable only fits one way, if gentle pressure is
used.

Other than that, easy as Pi, although xrandr can't report the correct gamma
size of this adapter. The OSD works fine and so I'm happy enough. Now to
check a the old screens, hopefully there a few LG in the lot  and close
enough to this modle to be able to use this cable.

Subject: [GTALUG] An Open Source Auto Time Tracker
Message-ID: <580E099F.9000202@mylesbraithwaite.com>

tl;dr Looking for an open source alternative to RescueTime and WakaTime.

I'm currently using RescueTime and WakaTime to track what I do and how
long I do it on my computer.

As an example RescueTime will tell me how many hours I have watched
YouTube last month (8h 56m) and WakaTime tracks how long I have worked
on a project in a text editor or IDE (i.e. I worked on my Ansible talk I
did at GTALUG last month for 6h 3m).

I use multiple computers and having that data in a convenient web
dashboard and sent to me in a weekly email is really beneficial to my
productivity.

The issue with WakaTime and RescueTime is they are proprietary software
and services. I haven't been able to find a good Open Source project
that replicates their core functionality (i.e. a central place to store
the data and a good auto time tracker).

I was wondering if there is a good open source alternative?

I'd suggest it being worth looking into Project Hamster

https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster

This is sorta-Gnome-oriented, with several mechanisms to collect data:
- data gets collected into a sqlite database, which, for personal time
tracking, seems reasonably apropos
- Desktop infrastructure for some data collection (mumble, dunno...)
- dbus-based data collection
- cli-based data collection

It was somewhat defunct for a while, but seems to have emerged to
having some new developers.

The tough part, of course, is injecting data collection into appropriate places.

- I would suppose it to be interesting to write something to query the
sqlite databases underlying FIrefox/Chrome to draw web history into
things.
- Presumably one could inject a data collector into a favored text
editor to find out what it was used on
- Collecting X events to see what X clients got accessed would provide
some data of interest

Of course, all those proposed ideas are weaselly to the extreme; all
"Simple Matters Of Programming."

A quick partial answer -- I found this tracker search provider extension
for gnome-shell:
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/783/tracker-search-provider/

It doesn't work with GNOME 3.22 out of the box, but downloading the source
code and changing the shell-version in metadata.json and copying the files
to .local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/tracker-search-provider at sinnix.de as
suggested in the README seems to work.  it's not bad. I'm looking forward
to integrating this into emacs now...

Would love to hear success stories with recoll, or comparisons of tracker &
recoll if people have them.

OK, so I did this

dd if=some.iso of=/dev/sdb

oops -- that's not the USB key! that's my internal m.2 drive!

The partition table is gone, but it used to contain 2 partitions, both of
them in an LVM, one of them part of an extended logical volume that added
space to /home on my overburdened main drive. I haven't lost much data
(just the first 700mb were overwritten), and amazingly my laptop continues
to run just fine -- even though lvscan reports a missing drive, apparently
the data is still findable.

I'd like to restore the partition table but I don't know where the
partition boundaries are, and in any case I don't know how to write a
partition table (!). What tools should I use? Preferably without turning
off my laptop, since I'm afraid it won't boot back up again!

The partition table is still in memoryso you will have some luck till 
you reboot or force the system to do a partprobe.

The following link points to how to recover your partition from the in 
system data:
http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43922/how-to-read-the-in-memory-kernel-partition-table-of-dev-sda

That being said first you should  back up all the data you can to an 
external drive
If your going to play with testdisk then it is best to learn on an image 
of the broken drive so copy the whole drive off to some other system to 
play with.

I have trashed enough systems in my time to know that a good backup is 
the best way to insure that things go well.

Apart from the data loss, right now you're in a good position to recover
things.

First, make a copy of /proc/partitions for reference in case you need to
restore from it.

You have a few options:

1. Restore LVM since you're using that:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/mdatarecover.html

Those backups have saved me on multiple occasions.

2. testdisk is a great tool for these kinds of problems. Download and
run it from /dev/shm. It may not find the deleted partitions or see in
memory stuff, but it won't hurt to try.

3. Use your /proc/partitions as a reference, since it has a list of the
partitions from before the dd operation. With it you could reconstruct a
partition table if the LVM restore steps don't work.

http://prefetch.net/blog/index.php/2009/12/20/using-the-linux-parted-utility-to-re-create-a-lost-partition-table/
for more on that approach.

Good luck!

oh man, all of that looks really helpful, folks.  At work now (with my
laptop safely plugged in and not hibernating!!) -- I will try when I get
back home.  I'll report back when I'm (hopefully) successful.

Last top post on this thread.

The first working LCD was an LG recycled from a Toshiba. That laptop needed
the MB video chip to be refloated  Thanks to Peter who let me have it for
tinkering. I never got around to refloating it but the LCD is working ok.
The next one was a 15 in LCD from an older Toshiba where I was trying to
override the MP Bios bug. This LCD is Chungwei and worked with the supplied
cable.

Apparently there is a kernel setting setting which would allow me to
correctly overrid ACPI and set the DSDT. Have yet to try that on the other
Toshiba from Peter. It's stripped and boots SoaS. It's the only laptop
which runs on ac without the battery being installed.

The third Laptop was HP. While the LVDS pairs appear to be the same the
cable connector is a locking version and it appears that the pin offset,
which ensures the cable  orientation, is not present. I'm not able to find
a data sheet for it so I'm not going to try until I can get it under a
magnifying glass. The pcb is fastened to the screen in a manner which makes
it difficult to view the connection end on.

>From my reading and limited testing it looks like this setup is generic
enough to handle 17in and smaller LCDs. I'm not yet used to Raspbian but
I'm going to use the adapter on a PC and tinker with audio. The adapter has
headphone output but HDMI audio would be nice.
