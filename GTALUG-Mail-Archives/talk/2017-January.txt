I don't think so.

The MSYS tools tend to behave much more like native windows tools than
cygwin does.  Cygwin seems more like using the new ubuntu on windows
stuff, except that one is actual linux binaries rather than recompiled
for cygwin binaries.

You need a write only device.

You could boot from a CD/DVD which is write only.

Or possibly an SD card that has the write-lock enabled.

If the computer does not support an SD card you could use usb card 
reader to boot from.

Of course in the worst case situation someone smart enough could rewrite 
the BIOS and get around any boot device.

The intention is to put the device setup into the boot ROM, so it can't 
(easily) change, but the working assumption is that one can

  * discard the privilege used to set up the device , or
  * be physically unsettable after it is initialized

I don't know the  privilege primitives  for intel/ARM, or if one needs a 
latch somewhere to make the device write-once: I'd love to talk to 
someone who does.

I have not had much experience with ARM booting but with Intel devices a 
normal linux kernel has the ability to write any and all devices.

If you boot with something like Xen then you should be able to lock out 
some devices because the Xen kernel is actually managing the system 
security.

There is a Xen kernel available for ARM but I have never worked with it.

Likely the easiest would be to put the boot into a write protected USB 
device.

Take a look at 
http://www.fencepost.net/2010/03/usb-flash-drives-with-hardware-write-protection/

It appears that my suggestion of an SD card may have a bad one since 
from the above article SD cards are using the switch only as a signal to 
the OS of write-protectedness.

Not enough information for me to understand the constraints.

What's your threat model?  

- Are you scared of the OS, the user of the OS, or something else?

- Are you scared of random misbehaviour or an intentional attack

- Can you control physical access to all or part of the system?

What would enforce change prevention?  Some things come to mind:

- the device itself could be set in an unchangeable mode after setup

  + eg. a physical switch that latches until "reset" (but this becomes
    a recursive problem:  how to prevent the OS from resetting the
    device).

- security through obscurity: ability to change the device is hidden
  behind a secret handshake only known to the initiates.  We generally
  distrust this kind of approach.

- security through a layer of indirection that implements the
  protection policy that you require

  + put a little controller (Raspberry Pi?) between the device and the
    computer.  You would probably need physical protection of the device
    from the Bad Guys (an OS?  A bad operator?)

  + run the OS under a VM system that implements the policy.

  + Conventional PCs have a mysterious "SMM" that overrides anything
    that the OS thinks it can do.  It is part of the firmware commonly
    called the BIOS and isn't easily mucked with by mortals.  With a
    high enough budget, SMM might be a useful vector.

But maybe you already have a solution in mind, with some blank bits,
and haven't sketched this for us.

Can you tell me more about this?:

- I think that there is room to install a 3.5" drive in the computer.
 (The computer came with the required mounting screws).  This is a
 BIG bonus: it provides a bunch of interesting options.  So it would
 be reasonable to add an SSD or HDD.  This would provide sufficient
 space for leaving Win 10 and installing Linux on the added drive.
 This added load might shrink battery life.
—
I would like to have more storage space—the 32GB drive seems kind of small. Have you determined if this is possible? If yes, is SSD a better way to go? From everything I’ve read it would seem so, but you mention both, so I would like your opinion. Lastly, where can I go do get this done for me? I’ve never done any kind of work (upgrades, repairs) on a computer myself so I would like to leave this to an expert.

Many thanks.

Did you mean a 2.5" drive?  3.5" sounds unlikely.

If this is the Asus E402SA, then according to
http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/ASUS/e402sa it is
possible to install a 2.5" 9.5mm drive in it.  I highly doubt it could
handle a 12.5mm.

https://www.ipc-computer.eu/notebook-ersatzteile/asus/notebook-e-serie/e402sa-2a/festplatte-5
also says a 9.5mm drive can go in it.

I got an ad from NCIX for systems with Intel's new Kaby Lake processors.  
Here's the headline:

	UP TO
	[LARGER FONT] 28% BETTER PERFORMANCE* [/LARGER FONT]
	versus a 3-year-old-desktop

The footnote shows that a i7-7700K processor system was being compared 
with a i7-4770K.  Some of the improvement would be in DDR4 vs DDR3 and so 
on.  OS and video card were the same.  The power requirement of the CPU 
went up slightly.

You'd normally expect a 7xxx processor to be compared with a 6xxx 
procecessor, but they've reached back an extra two generations to show 
even a modest 28% improvement.

There are useful features added to the processors since the Haswell 
generation.  Like a working TSX-NI: Haswell had it, with bugs, so Intel 
suppressed it with a microcode update.  Not completely fair since the K 
models never had it.

Intel has put a lot of extra transistors into on-chip video, something 
useful at least sometimes.  Perhaps this shows where Intel feels it needs 
to compete -- AMD has a better on-chip GPU but an uncompetitive CPU.  One 
can only hope that AMD's Zen/Ryzen lives up to AMD's talk.

I am new to Bash scripts.

Run one at a time the command runs fine.

When I execute this script I get an error about an unknown parameter. I

Can someone help me correct?

Thank you!

Shouldn't you be quoting $f and $nFname separately, e.g.
  avconv -i "$f" -c:v libx264 -c:a copy "$nFname"
otherwise filenames with spaces will see -i catch only part of the filename.

Try adding echo in front of the avconv command and see what would be 
executed from within the script.

Quotes. I second to that.

To see how the script are interpreting things, run bash -vx script.sh.

Or install and use bashdb (bash debugger). It's very, very useful.

Or
nFname="${base}.mp4"

Using brackets you can mix variables and text and create something like
this:
newName="${oldname}-bkp-${filedate}.${extension}.old"

Hmm... yes.  Now that you mention it, the quoting here is unnecessary,
because it's variable assignment and further splitting is not done.

Mac's AirDrop ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirDrop ) is wonderfully
simple and quite fast - but only supported on Mac (that I'm aware of).
Has anyone tried NitroShare (
https://github.com/nitroshare/nitroshare-desktop ), Dukto (
http://www.msec.it/blog/?page_id=11 ), or any other cross-platform
alternatives?  Encryption is a requirement, which I think lets Dukto
out.  I'd consider a Linux-only solution, but would prefer
cross-platform.  I'm looking for local-only solutions, so "Dropbox" or
anything else that reaches out to the Internet isn't a viable
solution.

# Round Table Q&A Session

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

* 6:00 pm - Please discuss on the general mailing list (i.e. <talk at gtalug.org>) where you want to go for dinner.
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting, a group of GTALUGers move to The Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more socializing.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who represents the community officially or informally, claims affiliation or participates directly. It applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here: <http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

Well at the same clock the 7xxx and 6xxx are apparently the same speed
in almost all cases.  7xxx is a bit more power efficient though, and
can hence overclock a bit more.

But yes, not a big leap this time at all.  There is a new chipset
generation to go with it, although apparently some of the existing 100
series boards can already support the new chip at least with a bios update.

Well at least on some models they are improving graphics, but I am not
sure that is the case on all models.

I still have a happy Core2 Q6600 running, which was released 10 years
ago, and I would not consider it a slow machine.  Sure it doesn't match
my i7-3960X machine, but that would not be a fair comparison anyhow.

Subject: [GTALUG] Samba Nobody (File ownership) problems returns
Message-ID: <b1a58d55-0aba-7270-dab0-090ec2428989@rogers.com>

Scenario

Samba is installed and used on server running Ubuntu 16.10. In addition 
to server software, normal desktop programs are installed. Certain 
folders are shared. Guests may access and create files. Windows 
computers copy files to the shared folders. These files have ownership 
of nobody:nobody I have two Windows 10 computers. The problem happens 
with both,

Desired behaviour

These files are given ownership of the owner of the directory.

Method

The samba.conf file has an entry for each shared folder, like this:

[public]
comment = Stephen Public
path = /home/stephen/Public
writeable = yes
; browseable = yes
guest ok = yes
force user = stephen
force group = stephen

Situation

This has been working as desired since I did a new install of 16.10. 
Today I noticed the nobody ownership problem. I had it after the install 
of 16.10 because I forgot to update samba.conf. Hence the return of the 
problem.

It has been a week since I did a file copy that worked as desired. I 
copy files infrequently.

It is worse. A sudo chown to change permissions to stephen:stephen 
executed without error. But within nautilus the context menu on the 
files had the commands to rename and delete greyed out. Even though the 
permissions section of the properties did say the ownership was changed.

I have not made any configuration changes. I have performed one, maybe 
two, system updates. There has also been a Windows 10 update.


Any and all help appreciated.

Hi Dave,

I love Apple TVs, and would gladly accept one (they are a bit hard to find).

However I have a terrible cold and am racing to get ready for the semester
that starts on Friday, so will not be able to get to the meeting tomorrow
(I live seriously in the boonies!).

If no-one takes you up on your offer, you could leave it in the tall metal
cabinet at the back of the room (I just went and checked and it's
unlocked), and I could pick it up on Wednesday morning.

BTW, what didn't you like about it?

Thanks  ../Dave

I hit reply.... not reply-all... and my email went to the world!!!  Is
there a reason for this?

I checked... if I do reply-all, it goes to the same 3 places, *plus* the UU

*sigh*

Ohh... maybe it's because I top-posted! :-) :-)

The braces are not necessary here. This will work fine:

newName="$oldname-bkp-$filedate.$extension.old"

Braces would be necessary if you were using underscores instead of
hyphens because they can be part of a variable name:

newName="${oldname}_bkp_$filedate.$extension.old"

Are braced incorrect here? I've been putting braces around all
variable names, so that there are fewer syntax exceptions for me to
remember...

I almost always use them. Only left them out for very simple scripts.

It's not really necessary all the time, but better safe than sorry...

They are not incorrect, just unnecessary.

The only time they are necessary is when the variable name is followed
by a character that is legal in a variable name.

Or when modifying the output of the variable expansion.

I thought this might be of interest to some people on the list (this weekend):

Brought to you by Toronto Mesh, ‘State of our Networks’ is a one-day,
hands-on conference about the past, present, and future of building
our own network infrastructures to communicate and access the internet
in our city. Join us for:

- hands-on workshops* to build mesh nodes and learn about low-power networks
- talks about a history of Toronto’s internet
- planning how to build resilient and accessible communications
networks and connections to the internet

I'm interested in dinner.  I propose Kaiju, in the food court in the 
basement of the Aura building, 384 Yonge St.

We were last there in April.

Each of us can choose which vendor in the food court to use.

Greetings

Am trying to find (for need in the not to distant future) some of what
is normally called 'accounting' software (its really record keeping
software but that's a different argument!).

What are you using that is, or could be, multi-user and has room for
some complexity?
(I am presently using 10 digit account numbers to get the granularity I want.)

For business uses, we use Odoo. It's open source and simple enough to 
get started with a couple business functions like accounting. We 
actually launched the Odoo Toronto meetup group with another Odoo 
service provider (OERP). See https://www.meetup.com/Odoo-Toronto/ (slow 
right now)

For personal use, I found that Gnucash does the job.

Could have used that meetup a few yrs ago. I was working with a manufacture
in Mississauga that wanted to replace the homebrew ERP system(access??
Blaaaa) and I was in the stages of rebuilding it using OpenERP(Odoo) but
they didn't like the flow because they had been doing the biz the same way
for over 30 yrs and just not possible in Odoo so they scrapped the
project/and me :)

Now they realize that they have to make some change and decided to go with
http://openpro.com/ which isn't open at all.

Odoo can be tailored, but at a cost (oftentimes underestimated by the 
customer). However, it's the best solution for those who need a 
custom-fit system -short of building one from scratch of course :-)

Oh I clearly knew that but the older people in the company were always
pushing back. "Why do we need something new, we have this and it works"
clearly it didn't work. it was amazing how it actually did work, the
'access db' didn't use keys. The guy that dev'ed it linked tables with text
and not a unique key.... example "Part123" and "part123" were the same part
, but showed up as two different parts in the system. :) and depending who
used the application, they would update the inventory one which ever part
came up ... "part123 = 10 parts" and "Part123 = 14" over all 24 parts, but
funny when "part123 = 0" was down to 0 they would order more but actually
had 14 still in stock....

It's a looong story... the owner was set in his ways.

This topic is one thing that GTALUG should at least meet and talk about.
It is recurring and prevalent needs in all business.  With enough beer,
we'll think of something worth money.

I had pretty good luck with LedgerSMB.
It is a fork of SQL-ledger.
Both have a reasonable amount of Canadian content so it supports our tax 
structure.

It's written in perl and is reasonably extensible.

After reading some of the responses from others I would put out there 
that its worth taking a look at LedgerSMB.
It is Open and there is paid support and an Accounting as a service 
based on it.

I feel obligated to point out freshbooks.com as Accounting as a Service
based here in Toronto.  I do work there, so I'm a touch biased, but it
provides multiple users, mobile apps (android and iOS), as well as browser
based ui.

I feel obligated to point out here that it is more often the case that
a cloud provider is more secure than a standalone solution. If only
because they can afford to spend more on hiring people to work on
security full time.

And you have to take their word for it that they did that.

If they did not and loose it all, or decide to shut down the company
suddenly, how do you get the accounting data that you are almost certainly
legally required to keep for a number of years?

So is the cloud service safer than what lots of companies do themselves?
Sure.  Is it safer than doing it right?  Almost certainly not.

I feel obligated to point out here that it is more often the case that
a cloud provider is more secure than a standalone solution. If only
because they can afford to spend more on hiring people to work on
security full time.


I'd agree with this. Point to point, and end to end a larger network of
trusted users tends to be more stable, from a security standpoint, than an
ad hoc network.

TOR endpoint monitoring is one kind of example of how security through
obscurity was easily thwarted. However someone would still need the key, or
an enormous amount of resources to decrypt any actual data.

The web is only one class of internet layer transport. If your device is
personally secured and your app encrypts for push/pull telemetry, data is
generally safe enough when using the web as an entry point, operational
errors notwithstanding.

Similarly for me, but it's more of "privacy" factor for me.  However,
web outsourcing companies like Freshbooks.com do have advantage in
"invoicing".  They print and (e)mail invoices for you.

​I think it's reasonable to ​suggest that not all cloud solutions are
inherently less secure than all standalone systems.

One size does not fit all. Knowing the whole landscape is better than not
knowing it. All solutions will have strengths and weaknesses, the
priorities those in need will differ, and we're not here to judge.

One thing Freshbooks appears to do well is manage receivables, which is a
sore point among consultants I know -- quick invoicing, followups, and
facilitation of getting paid. This seems relevant to one of the points
brought up by one person at Tuesday's meeting (ie, getting paid).

​In the real world​. "right" (and other options) are subject to
cost-benefit analysis, with helpings of inertia and emotion tossed in for

The thing with most things like accounting packages is that the setup is 
a lot of work and they often take some significant care and feeding as 
time goes by.
I spent  a LOT of time fixing the invoice generation code to get 
something that I liked and felt looked professional and months importing 
data from our previous system.
And then I would spend hours a month tracking 
overpayments/underpayments, deadbeat customers.....


The thing to be said for "cloud" providers is that they often provide an 
easy to use quick start service.
For someone generating a few invoices a month and a small customer base 
it can make a lot of sense over building a system capable of managing 
thousands of customers and generating thousands of invoices monthly.

The problem is finding the right scale for your enterprise.

Wave <https://www.waveapps.com/> is another Toronto-based web accounting 
software provider. I know the people behind it and they know what 
they're doing. I would trust their security more than the security on 
the average small business network. As for the "What happens to my data 
if they go out of business?" question, I'd check with the vendor to find 
out how to export data and do it on a regular basis.

One of the criterion to what you should be using is to find out if your 
accountant is familiar with what you're using. If they are not, which is 
more important to you, your accountant or the software you use?

2.9% fee!  That's $29 for every $1000.  This begs a question... are you
using them?

Yes, eventually, you'd need to "export" to his/her format.

Note that this represents a 2.9% charge _for credit card processing._
Wave seem to be charging exactly the same rate as stripe.com, which is
one of the widely used such vendors.

That underlines that there's more to this than meets the eye.

That 2.9% isn't a charge "for accounting", it's a charge for processing
credit card purchases.

Apparently Wave makes their money out of handling credit card
processing, which is sorta interesting.

Hum?

That's sensible if you handle accounting by paying a third party accountant to
generate your accounting records.

At one time, that used to be one of (AccPac, Bedford Accounting), back in the
MS-DOS days.

But if you're actually managing your own accounting records, the question
will be, what will your accountant charge for *reviewing* your records, and
how does that vary based on what flavour of accounting system you're using.

Wave claims that they make it easy to share appropriate records with your
accountant; I imagine that's true.  Whether or not that makes Wave a good
choice is a separate question.

That's sensible if you handle accounting by paying a third party accountant
to
generate your accounting records.

At one time, that used to be one of (AccPac, Bedford Accounting), back in
the
MS-DOS days.


Don't forget VisiCac. In fact wasn't one of Microsoft's first succesfull
apps Excel for Mac, eventually replacing VisiCalc. Harvard Graphics and
Crystal Reports were also later used for assembling printed reports. It was
said that Excels engine could process up to 1,000,000 records using input
and output forms before you had to upgrade to Access RDBMS.


But if you're actually managing your own accounting records, the question
will be, what will your accountant charge for *reviewing* your records, and
how does that vary based on what flavour of accounting system you're using.

Wave claims that they make it easy to share appropriate records with your
accountant; I imagine that's true.  Whether or not that makes Wave a good
choice is a separate question.

Ah yes - - - the 'wonderful' accountant.

Well, I dropped using an accountant when I went to a major firm and gave
them my docs (which were laid out by GIFI codes) so only needed transferring
to whatever they were using and explained that I saw three scenarios. That was
to a junior member. About 2 weeks later I arrived for my appointment and was
now told that due to the complexity of my stuff (one business, farming and a
personal return) a senior member of the firm was required. He told me
that I had
3 different scenarios to consider (my bill had also gone up by 250%). Told
that (expletives deleted) that what he had told me was almost exactly what
I had told the junior member I had started with. Told him as he didn't provide
any value for fees that I thought that I didn't really need his services.
Paid the useless sucker and left.

Didn't use another until a bank forced me to use an accountancy firm (which
made an error (you are responsible for any errors even if someone else makes
them on your behalf you know)). So now I'm much more likely to ask them if they
would prefer to deal with Enron or me (Enron was managed by accountants
and lawyers!) and leave.
Have found a few other things that I couldn't get advice on from them so now
I have a few trusted advisors - - - - but NO accountant!

Revenue Canada has reams of documents available. Often answer complex
questions too. Got one senior advisor to change some stuff by using logic
- - - that sort of surprised me. Hadn't run into too many thinking bureaucratic
types before!

YMMV

When we started our first company we used an accounting firm the first year.
YEP. That was a waste of money.
We now use an accountant who lives in Simcoe.
He does our taxes and year end statements but the book-keeping is done 
by us.
He does a fine job and does not have the overhead of some guy on Bay St.
He has provided lots of good advise on taxes and other issues but we are 
both happy for him to keep away from the book-keeping parts.

I bought a couple very small mini USB to USB-C adapters at GearBest for
close to nothing. I keep one of those on my car, home, workplace... They
are so small you can keep one in the wallet.

Haven't needed to use them yet...

I don't know if I mentioned before.  I had USB-C to micro-USB adapter,
and it can charge but didn't work with keyboard/mouse.  This time, I got
proper one-piece cable (no adapters in between).

Hi Charles,

You might also contact KWLUG, as they are in your geographical region
of interest. Also, some members of KWLUG have experience organizing
large F/LOSS conferences.

This was a bad job of cut-n-paste on my part. I meant to say Toronto
area. I am interested in seeing Canada host Flock 2017 regardless of
Kitchener / Waterloo or Toronto.

So, if there is interest in Toronto it would be fantastic to see a bid
from the Toronto area as well.

My apologies for the bad cut-n-paste.

Charles

Flock is a successor to FUDCon.  In 2009 FUDCon was hosted by CDOT of 
Seneca at York.  I enjoyed it a lot.  Several TLUG folks attended but I 
don't remember if any presented or organized.  The CDOT people did a great 
job.

CDOT seems to be good at this.  They do a great job with FSOSS each year.  
I don't remember any other regular local Linux event.  I have no idea if 
they are willing to or would be allowed to repeat.

I've reached out to Chris Tyler at Seneca/CDOT.

He's joined the list and would be best able to explain what resources 
are available along with some compelling reasons to delay our bid for 
the 2019 flock.

Hi All,

I'm personally very interested in bringing Flock to Toronto; I led the
effort to bring FUDcon (the predecessor event) to Toronto in December 2009
and the success of that event, the first community-hosted FUDcon, led to
the FUDcon bid process that in turn evolved into the Flock process. I've
been thinking about a follow-up event ever since.

However, I don't think the time is quite right yet, especially if we want
to do this with support from Seneca CDOT...

- CDOT is a possible venue for a Toronto Flock, since we would have the
space and resources (network, A/V, foodservice) available in the summer.
However, the campus is still ripped up with construction, the subway
extension is not yet open, and CDOT is undergoing some internal
reorganization.
- The last North American Flock was in this corner of the continent (just
across the lake in Rochester, NY).
- Tourism resources (hotel space, etc) may be impacted by the
sesquicentennial this summer.
- The bid time is short (~5 weeks).

If we put together a coalition of interested parties (GTAlug, CDOT, other
groups) and aim at the next North American Flock (2019), we should have
plenty of time to put together a really solid bid, including a nice new
subway between accommodation, presentation venues, and social activities.

I'm very open to other perspectives and ideas on this, if there's a strong
case for doing this in 2017 -- discussion welcome.

-Chris

I agree that the time may not be ideal given everything you laid out.

There were not a large number of bids for last year and I wanted to see
a solid slate of choices for Flock this year. I am from Rochester and
did not think they would choose the same location again. This led me to
think of both GTA and KWLUG as having the interest and strength to
organize a bid.

Message-ID: <1bc996e2-f9cb-9f6f-cc3e-316caf2d16a1@ss.org>

I was recently issue an new laptop from work. Of course, being in a 
sysadmin position, and giving the latitude to use the tools I deem 
necessary, I replaced the disk and installed Fedora 25.

I felt it was also time to take the plunge with UEFI booting.

The Problem
===========

After installation, the first boot was successful. After applying 
updates, boot failed.

This was repeatable after a second re-install, and following updates.

Symptoms
========

System boots, and goes to a blue and white UI called 'MokManager.efi'.

Research revealed this to be a UI for enrolling encryption keys for 
secure boot.

http://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/secureboot.html
MOKs—A Machine Owner Key (MOK) is a type of key that a user generates 
and uses to sign an EFI binary. The point of a MOK is to give users the 
ability to run locally-compiled kernels, boot loaders not delivered by 
the distribution maintainer, and so on.

Trouble Shooting
================

Firstly, I confirmed that secure boot was disabled in the laptops firmware.

Next, I booted a rescue image. Mounted the EFI partition and investigated.

mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot     # grub2 boot partition
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi # EFI partition

We then find the MokManager.efi under the following path in our rescue 
environment.
/mnt/boot/efi/EFI/fedora/MokManager.efi

I removed this executable to see what I could discover from the boot 
process.

Upon reboot, I was greeted with message of grub2-x64.efi listed as being 
corrupt, failing through to MokManager.efi that was now missing, and 
another optional efi executable that was also missing.


Repair
======

fsck.vfat /dev/sda1
- preformed removal of dirtybit>
- FATs didn't agreed, selected the first one at random. Going to restore 
firmware anyways.

mkdir /mnt/chroot
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/chroot          # root filesystem
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/chroot/boot     # grub2 boot partition
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/chroot/boot/efi # EFI partition

# Make devices and process table avaliable
for j in /dev /dev/pts /sys /proc; do mount -B $j /mnt/chroot$j; done

# Make DNS avaliable inside the chroot
cp /etc/resolve.conf /mnt/chroot/etc/resolve.conf

chroot /mnt/chroot

# re-install grub2 EFI executables
yum reinstall grub2-efi shim

# leave the chroot
exit

umount /mnt/chroot/boot/efi

fsck.vfat /dev/sda1 # just to sanity check that it's still clean.

reboot


Success
=======

Machine booted normally with the latest kernel form updates.


Notes
=====

1) I've simplified my device names for convince of conveying the process 
followed. Adjust appropriately for your circumstances and disk layout.

2) In Fedora 25 is a symylink, /etc/resolv.conf -> 
/var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf, I had to copy this instead, your 
distro may vary.

3) There was no left over EFI partition from a previous system. This was 
all done on a blank hard drive.

4) Frankly, I found all of this far simpler to manage then a classical 
MBR based boot loader. I was able to use standard tools to investigate 
and repair the boot chain. No special gurb-install commands or dinking 
with config files.

5) None of this explains why a normal update left the boot partition in 
a unclean state to being with. But if it happens again, it's an easy 
enough repair, just a little time consuming.

Thank you Mr Scott for your cogent and detailed description of both the
problem and the solution you found. Wished I had had such to guide me
when I set up my system on uefi 4 years ago.

Thanks muchly!!

Message-ID: <48d8256b-1275-1bc8-215d-739255b7afdd@galeahome.ca>

I am seeing a problem at boot time that has appeared in kernels after 
4.3.0-1-amd64.

My system will boot, show the available debian kernels, select the 
latest and then jump into initramrs.  It claims it can not mount dev and 
other partitions and, indeed, an ls on the mounted /dev/sda1 shows that 
my esata drive has been mounted as root!

To boot properly I must power off the esata, boot and wait until the 
boot is proceeding from the system disk, then power up the esata.

The bios boot order is set to boot from the (correct) system disk.

/etc/fstab is set to boot using UUIDs, and all UUIDs are correct.

The esata drive is not bootable.

Can anyone suggest something to look at or try? I would expect that if 
grub was able to show me my images it would be able to load them, even 
if the esata was available.

Does anyone own an NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet K1 and can they recommend it?  I 
am looking for a recommendation of this tablet for the purpose of web 
and email.

I have heard that it being a gaming tablet with four cores at 2.2 Ghz, 
it should be overkill for the intended use.  But that is just what I want.

If anyone knows of a better android based tablet, please let me know.

Debian generates an initramfs at kernel-install time; is it possible
that the esata was mounted when you installed that kernel?  Maybe run
update-initramfs again after booting without the esata connected.

Linux can get its own weird ideas about enumeration order of disks,
network cards, PCI slots, etc, and that's why we have UUIDs and I
thought the Debian initramfs ought to remember the specific UUID of the
root device it was generated to use.  However, I don't have any
Debian-amd64 hardware to check at home here.

Anthony's advise is good, as it's a path to resolving the problem.

To but it does not include how to diagnose how the root device is 
selected, or how to tell if it's been change successfully too what you 
desire.

For myself, I would look at the following places.

1) at boot time, interrupting and appending or editing the boot entry.

2) checking your boot loaders config, which is easy with grub, grub2 
configs on the other hand are terrible opaque to read.

3) At run time, by looking at the cmdline file under /proc which is the 
kernel's command line after booting.

Some samples form my machines:

[scott at failfast ~]$ cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-4.8.16-300.fc25.x86_64 
root=/dev/mapper/fedora_failfast-root ro rd.lvm.lv=fedora_failfast/root 
rd.luks.uuid=luks-e37ae023-0aba-417d-82df-157338c8515d 
rd.lvm.lv=fedora_failfast/swap rhgb quiet LANG=en_US.UTF-8

[root at muse ~]# cat /proc/cmdline
BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-3.10.0-514.2.2.el7.x86_64 
root=UUID=4530cd0d-10ed-4fca-a056-534a38e1e717 ro crashkernel=auto 
rd.md.uuid=1a674618:ee5747c9:08996bc7:5fff0b7d 
rd.md.uuid=7b9c4991:59009b72:0980bbc3:1ccacf58 
rd.md.uuid=18e8b34b:857cab8d:b85d6f0b:30f32d9d rhgb quiet LANG=en_CA.UTF-8


In all cases your looking for the root= parameter.

Sure, almost certainly..

Thanks Anthony,
I tried unmount+poweroff esata and "update-initramfs -u" and reboot but 
no success.

It still boots from the hard disk but attempts to mount the OS from 
esata. The only difference is that the timing of when I have to switch 
on the esata is now "very tight" at less than a few seconds after I get 
the clean message from fsck, or boot fails (missing mount in fstab).

Thanks Scott,

cat /proc/cmdline indicated GRUB2 was trying to boot from /dev/sda1 
despite the provisioning for UUIDs in /etc/fstab.

In debian, the /etc/default/grub file has a line 
"GRUB_DISABLE_LINUX_UUID=true".  Commenting that out, update-grub2 and 
reboot and a now have a nice clean boot.

There are Android tablets for all tastes and needs.  You have to
figure out what matters to you.  That's not actually easy.  I found
out by living with a few tablets for some time.

The rest of this is about my impressions.  Others may feel differently.

I imagine that I would find it intolerable to use a tablet without a
keyboard for routine email.

I do find tablet keyboards not very good:  if you want a keyboard on a
portable device, it is hard to beat the clamshell laptop form-factor.
Even tablets that imitate the clamshell get it wrong: either a fixed
angle or too much of the weight behind the screen (balance problems).

For web browsing, I find a tablet very nice.  I can lounge in a way
that you cannot do with a clamshell.  For browsing, I love my Nexus 10
(light, high-res screen, longish battery life, no fan noise).

I have two convertible laptops that can fold up to be like a tablet.
I never use that feature.  Why?

- conventional Linux distros (I use Fedora) don't handle tablet
  gestures usefully.

- when folded up, these things still have fans

- they still weigh the same, much more than a tablet

- on one (Yoga 2 Pro), the keyboard remains exposed on the underside.
  That just feels weird.  And Linux leaves it enabled (last I
  checked).

- battery life is much shorter than a tablet

Large tablets are nice to use.  Small ones are nicer to carry.  I
never take my 10" tablet out of the house.  My Android phone does most
tabletty things when I'm out and about.  If I need somthing better, I
take a notebook computer.  There doesn't seem to be a sufficient niche
for something between the phone and a notebook when on the road.

I have a few smaller tablets that I don't use.  Some run Windows.  I
intended to put Linux on those but that's probably silly.

Tablets have limited lifetimes.  The manufacturers soon get tired of
releasing updated firmware.  You can decide how much that matters.  I
have an original iPad and never turn it on because it has been
unsupportd for so long.  The Nexus 10 has been unsupported for Andoid
6, but it is still fine for now.  You can get a Kobo Arc 10HD tablet
with great specs for about $100 but its firmware is uncomfortably old
(there is a CyanogenMod for it but not well debugged).

====

Cheap Windows tablets often have resource limitations that are
unreasonable.  1G of RAM is too little.  16G of eMMC is too little;
even 32G is tight but anything more bumps the licensing cost a lot.
1280x800 resolution is not great these days.  To top that off, Windows
isn't that useful as a tablet OS (but it is better than a conventional
Linux distro).

(I have a tablet with 64-bit Windows.  It can run the
Ubuntu-under-Windows thing that Microsoft has released.  32-bit
Windows (used in many tablets even though the processors can run
64-bit code) cannot do that.  But so far I hardly ever use that
tablet.)

Tablet screens are typically better than notebook screens until you
pay a lot for the notebook.  I find this annoying and unreasonable.
IPS is almost universal in tablets and rare in inexpensive notebooks.
Way too many notebooks are only 1366x768.  The Nexus 10 and Kobo Arc
10HD have 2560x1600 pixels -- roughly four times as many.  The Nexus 7
and Kobo Arc 7HD have 1920x1200.

I don't do gaming.  It seems that a lot of games are now targetted at
phones and tablets.  The nVidia Shield is probably the best gaming
tablet but I am not a good source for this.  nVidia has a Toronto

That would certainly explain it.

I think some years ago there was a question during a package install
about switching to UUIDs, and if you told it no at that time, it would
have written that entry to the grub config.  That would be when Debian
was transitioning to the UUID use for grub.

I think the question isn't even asked anymore, but apparently that
doesn't mean the value got removed from older systems when the question
was removed.

All I can find in the changelog is that a commented out line was added
in 2008 that could be uncommented to disable the use of UUID in grub.

Well the specs are certainly pretty good.

1920x1200 resolution on an 8" sounds rather nice.

16GB flash is not bad, especially when it has a uSD slot for extra space.

Quad Cortex-A15 at 2.2GHz is a fair bit of processing power, and 2GB
ram and the nvidia GPU certainly means some things should go at a
decent speed.  No idea what that means for battery life.  It appears to
have a decent sized battery at least.

Wifi/GPS/HDMI/etc all looks pretty good.

No 802.11ac, but 802.11a/n isn't bad either.

Camera isn't impressive, but who are these people taking pictures with
a tablet anyhow?

Android 6.0 available, so it isn't totally obsolete software wise.

I do agree that email on a tablet with a touch screen keyboard sounds
painful, but I guess if you are mainly reading it would be fine and some
of the android keyboard apps are better than others too, if you can get
used to their interesting writing methods.

I was looking at the same tablet to replace my Nexus 7 2013. Apparently
Nougat is now available as an update, so software wise it is not
obsolete. Plus, I found out that it is a pretty pristine Android
experience with very little bloatware. Great for the price with a decent
tablet with a microSD slot.

So looks limke 7.0 is in beta and should be released in a few weeks.
Well certainly keeping the software up to date then.

Much better than samsung tablets, that's for sure.

I enjoy using our Kobo ARC even without a keyboard. My beefs are that I 
want a bigger display and snappier web page rendering.  Also my wife and 
I both use the beast, and account switching gets to be a pain.

Our prime applications under Android are web browsing, email from our 
domains imap and mpdroid (for running our pi-based mpd server that pumps 
hdmi to the media center).

email: My wife has much better ways to draft and view more complex 
emails on a slow to boot computer, but she uses the Kobo to say yes to 
acting gigs (as an extra). When a casting call goes out via email, the 
first responders usually get the job.  So she likes the Kobo's sub-30 
second trip into the mail app, where she can seize the prize.

I real question is, will web pages render faster on a faster tablet?  If 
most of the time to render a page is fetching the page and not tab 
creation + rendering, then I would probably go for a bigger android tablet.

PS: I wish Canada Computers would take one out of the box for me to try 
but they don't display that unit, just stock it.
