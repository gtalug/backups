# OpenStreetMap with Stewart Russell

OpenStreetMap is more than just a web mapping platform. It's a
comprehensive, community-maintained map/geodatabase of the world that
you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years
ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers,
developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of
using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little
drama, and how it succeeds as a community.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before the meeting a group of GTALUGers will be dining at
It's All Grk (101 Dundas St East).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East).

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Subject: [GTALUG] ICANN's Proposal to Move IANA
Message-ID: <1430930541.24607.2.camel@larva.gordhome.local>

Hi, all:

You probably know that in March 2014, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
announced its intent to “transition its stewardship role of the IANA
Functions and related management”.   This meant that NTIA will no longer
oversee a contract with ICANN to manage IANA.   ICANN will have to do it
itself.

To get this started, NTIA called on ICANN to “coordinate” the drafting
of a proposal to transition this stewardship role to the broader global
multi-stakeholder community.    This meant drafting of a proposal of its
own and inviting other proposals from IETF and the various numbers
registries (ARIN, RIPE and the others) and then coordinating them all
into one proposal to present to NTIA.

ICANN now has a (second) draft of its proposal “ready for comment” (this
request for public comment is fairly standard for ICANN policy
documents).

This one is important enough that we're asking you to look it over and
accept ICANN's invitation to comment.   Comments are going to be
accepted until May 20 – that's short, I know, but there it is.

Now, this is a pretty complex document – it's a kind of complex matter,
involving contract law (in California, where ICANN is registered), the
concerns of a lot of stakeholders outside the US, and the need for ICANN
to be seen to be accountable.

So, here it is.   Send your comments to me at gordon at look.ca and I'll
compile them into a group comment for ICANN.

https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/cwg-stewardship-draft-proposal-without-annexes-22apr15-en.pdf

I'm not sure you want to tackle the proposal with annexes.   It's
painful.

Enjoy

Subject: [GTALUG] Problem Installing Driver for Epson WF-2630
Message-ID: <554EBB29.6020604@rogers.com>

I am running Ubuntu 14.04

I downloaded the *.deb file from the Epson web site:

epson-inkjet-printer-escpr_1.4.5-1lsb3.2_i386.deb

It starts in the Ubuntu Software Centre, but I get an error message:

"New software can't be installed, because there is a problem with the 
software currently installed. Do you want to repair this problem now?"

I click "Repair".

I am prompted for my password. In a few seconds I return to the Ubuntu 
Software Centre.

I click "Install"

Then a window pops up saying "Package operation failed"

I check the details and I see:

"dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of 
epson-inkjet-printer-escpr:
epson-inkjet-printer-escpr depends on lsb (>= 3.2)."

So I download lsb-printing_4.0-0ubuntu8_i386.deb

I try to install, but the Ubuntu Software Centre prompts me to Remove.

So, at this point I am calling out for HELP!

Thanks in advance

Getting the right LSB package installed can be a pain. If you're not
using paper larger than Letter, the standard CUPS ESC/P-R driver
/should/ drive this printer fairly well.

I've had the larger (size of a small tank, to be honest) WF-7520 for
years, and it's been great. Duplex ADF scanning, SANE support over the
network, scan to SD card (which appears as a samba share on the network)
... it just works.

cheers,
 Stewart

I have confirmed that I have LSB 4.1 installed using the Ubuntu Software 
Centre.

But the install of the Epson driver still asserts a dependency error 
needed >=3.2

I have run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade.

Those will really be handy.  ;-)

I think I still have a 10baseT hub with a coax connector on it. 
However, I haven't noticed any ISA bus computers here for quite a while.

BTW, back in the mid '90s, I worked on a project to convert some
provincial government offices around Queen's Park from 10base2 to
10baseT.  In some cases, it was just a matter of changing the cables to
get the NIC on 10baseT.  Others were a minor config change, but others
had to be replaced.  There were also several HP printers that needed new
NICs.

My first experience with Ethernet was with a DECNET that connected some
VAX 11/780 systems.  That was the old 10base5 network with vampire taps.

you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years
ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers,
developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of
using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little
drama, and how it succeeds as a community.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before the meeting a group of GTALUGers will be dining at
It's All Grk (101 Dundas St East).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East).

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:
<http://gtalug.org/about/code-of-conduct/>.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members @

Could you try:

dpkg -l|grep lsb

and post the output.

And are you running 32 or 64bit system?  After all the driver package
you are trying to isntall is 32bit and you might be running a 64bit
system and hence be missing dependancies for that driver.

The main lsb package (not lsb-printing) which seems to be what it depends
depends on lsb-printing, lsb-graphics, lsb-core, and a number of other
packages.

Perhaps just doing 'apt-get install lsb' would solve the problem.

My 486 already has 2 (nice 3com cards too), and Debian no longer supports

This was the problem. Silly.

Using the 64bit driver fixed everything!

Yelp says "Yelpers report this location has closed.".  I tried phoning
and nobody answered.

I propose that we fall back to Love at First Bite.  Unless someone
finds that it is open.

Subject: [GTALUG] Postgres and ident used for authentication
Message-ID: <555495E7.3070107@rogers.com>

While it's been discussed elsewhere*, I just tripped over a decidedly 
odd default in postgresql: it tries to use ident to verify that the role 
I'm logging in to has the same name as my unix user account, simulating 
the "peer" authentication available for unix domain sockets.

I don't see any history for this, but It make me suspicious, just as it 
would if I found someone was using rsh and a .rhosts file in a world 
where we have ssh with keys.

The common recommendation is to use "trust", which is even worse than 
ident.  At least ident comes with a  conspicuous warning that "The 
Identification Protocol is not intended as an authorization or access 
control protocol."

Anyone know the back story?  The FAQ is unhelpful, the bugs list seems 
private, and Google finds lots of bad advice (;-))

Hi all — thanks so much for coming out the other night. Thanks to Scott,
Myles and the cast of 1000_2 s who make GTALUG happen.

Rather than post my presentation, which was kind of light on detail, I
thought I'd post some of the most useful but harder-to-remember links I
brought up:

 1. ‘The Map’ — http://www.openstreetmap.org  . It supports routing now,
    too.
 2. QGIS, an open GIS manager. It's rather good — http://qgis.org/
 3. The OSM Wiki; ridiculously complete documentation:
    https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/
 4. OSM Help Stack Exchange-style question/answer:
    https://help.openstreetmap.org/
 5. All of the OSM stats! — https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Stats
 6. Toronto map growth animation —
    http://www.geofabrik.de/gallery/history/index.html#toronto
 7. Crowdsourced geocoding (+ lawsuit from Canada Post) —
    http://geocoder.ca/
 8. Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL) —
    http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/
 9. Canada’s new Open Government portal — http://open.canada.ca
    related: Toronto Open Data — http://toronto.ca/open
10. CIPPIC Open Licensing Project (CLIP) — http://clipol.org/
11. Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team [HOT] — http://hotosm.org/
12. OpenCycleMap —
    http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/43.6666/-79.3785&layers=C
13. *The rather wonderful /uMap/* — https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/

uMap might be a decent way of mapping out some dinner choices pre GTALUG
meetings.

There's a monthly OSM Meetup, and also #maptime, the web mapping meetup.
Both are linked here: http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Toronto/

Best Wishes, and it was great to meet you all again,

Subject: [GTALUG] "ondemand" CPU governor not recommended for newer Intel
	machines
Message-ID: <20150516024259.GA16909@waltdnes.org>

  I've been putting together scripts that run under bash+ash to control
CPU settings.  I was unhappy with current solutions.  They seemed to be
either out-of-date, and no longer worked, or else pulled in egregiuous
dependancies.  In the course of researching stuff for my scripts, I ran
across a 2-year-old Phoronix article
http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTM3NDQ which
referenced a Google+ conversation at
https://plus.google.com/+TheodoreTso/posts/2vEekAsG2QT

  Summary... "ondemand" worked great for notebook CPUs from 10 years ago,
but...

> with modern Intel processors, the ondemand CPU governor is actually
> counterproductive because waking up to decide whether the CPU is idle
> keeps it from entering the deepest sleep states, and so (somewhat
> counterintuitively) the performance governor will actually result
> in the best battery life.

  I don't know if the above also applies to the "conservative" governor.
I put together an interactive script and an automated script.  I was
thinking along the following lines...
* notebook runs at "powersave" by default
* run a wrapper script
* wrapper script kicks up to "performance" setting
* launches the job you want done (kernel compile or whatever)
* drops back down to "powersave" mode after the job is finished

Love at First Bite (Pizza)

Kaiju (Curry)

Hookaido Ramen Santouka

Lou Dawg's (BBQ)

I would also like to suggest that we make Love at First Bite our

I mildly recommend against Lou Dawg's, as it very loud.

Hi all — this might be of interest to a limited number on this list, but
it really impressed me.

You will need:

  * USB MIDI hardware (though you can noodle on the keyboard much less

If you've got your MIDI set up, you've got a decent-ish emulation of a

I'm linking this here as my previous experience with MIDI on Linux was
highly dispiriting. If I could even get it to work, there was usually a
¼s or more delay between pressing a key and getting a note. This just
works. I'm impressed.

Message-ID: <55613EEC.206.23CE6765@sciguy.vex.net>

Hi folks:

This is even difficult to Google. I had been looking for some pictures 
(digital, natch) of a computer we referred to as an XL-87 back in university. 
They were old units back then too. I believe they were manufactured by Cybernex 
with the full name "Cybernex XL-87". My first exposure to an operating system 
was through these terminals, with the OS being a variant of UNIX.

But if anyone has photos of such a terminal, could you please email as an 
attachment off-list?

# GPG Key-Signing Party and Round Table Q&A Session

See the bottom of this email for instructions on the GPG Key-Signing Party.

A Round Table Q&A Session is where we take questions from the
audience, and the audience discusses and attempts to answer those
questions from their own knowledge. It's a great way to meet fellow
members of our community and discover the skill sets we each bring to
the table.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before each meeting a group of GTALUGers dine at Love At
First Bite (96 Gerrard Street E).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East) for refreshments and more
socializing.

# Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members.

# GPG Key-Signing Party

1. Create an OpenPGP keypair for yourself (if you haven't) already.

2. Print or write down your key fingerprint and bring it with you.
You'll have to confirm at the signing that the list is correct for
your key.

3. Send your public key before the event to the `pgp.mit.edu` keyserver.

4. Bring a goverment-issued picture ID of yourself.

### At the Key Signing Party

1. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

2. Each participant should meet up face to face with every other
participant to receive their key fingerprint and examine their ID, and
to give them your key fingerprint and have them examine your ID.

### After the Key Signing Party

1. Find the key ID on the fingerprint. The fingerprint will have an
8-character ID listed after the key size. Typically it looks like
this: '1024D/64011A8B'. The actual ID portion is the '64011A8B'.
You'll notice this is also the last 8 characters of the fingerprint
itself.

2. Fetch the public key using the key ID. If you're running GnuPG on
the command line, you can do this by typing: `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys <KeyID>` (where KeyID is obviously the ID of
the key you want).

3. Check that the fingerprint of the key you've just fetched matches
the fingerprint on the slip of paper: `gpg --fingerprint <KeyID>` and
compare it with the hard copy in front of you.

4. If (and only if) you are happy that the fingerprints match and the
person showed you sufficient ID, you can do the actual 'signing' part
of the process: `gpg --sign-key <KeyID>` and answer the questions it
asks.

5. Next you need to send the signed copy of their key back to them.
Now upload the signed key back to the server `gpg --keyserver
pgp.mit.edu --send-key <Key_ID>`. You should get back something like
'gpg: sending key <Key_ID> to hkp server pgp.mit.edu'.

### Help

Get your KEYID from your keyring as the part following the 1024D/ as follows:

    gpg --list-secret-keys | grep sec

Here is how to send your key to the keyserver:

    gpg --keyserver gpg.mit.edu --send-keys <KEYID>

Get your fingerprint information:

    gpg --fingerprint KEYID

Greetings

I'm hoping that someone out there has achieved success and can point me to
some pointers!

I bought a Brother MFC-J6510DW largely because it can scan 11 x 17 inch
documents (I have too many like that that I would like to get into
electronic format!!).

I can see the machine as a printer but cannot get the machine to scan a
page. I have installed XSane 1.0.24 backend and XSane1.0.14 frontend. Tried
running the ethernet cable through the router (a la network usage) and
can't get anything useful to occu. I have also tried running the ethernet
cable directly into my main machine (Debian testing) with also no joy. Have
also contacted Brother support and although their website and the stickers
on the machine laud their online chat and telephone support for linux its
email support (if they can be bothered! (they are taking a very long time
to respond!!)).

Any suggestions?

TIA

Hi Dee

Can this device scan to an SD card, and if so, does the printer export that
card as a network share? That's the approach I have to take with my Epson.
I pick the resulting PDFs apart into TIFF scans and add good-enough OCR
with Tesseract.

While I can get SANE to work for single page scans, it doesn't drive the
ADF or duplexer properly.

Cheers

I use a Brother printer at work, but it's been a long time since I set
it up.  I do remember that there were separate drivers for printing
and scanning.  I'm able to use "Simple Scan" in Ubuntu and it pulls
the scan from the machine.  I don't think I was able to get it to scan
from the printer and have it send to my machine.

You may have already seen this, but here's where all the driver files
are located:  http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=mfcj6510dw_all&os=128

It seems that to get the scanning to work from the printer end I would
have to also install the "scan key tool".  (not really a concern of
mine, though)

I have a Brother DCP-7065DN.  The situation is just as you describe.
I have to install drivers for each function on each client machine.

I would not have bought it if I had known that it required proprietary
binary drivers.  But it does work, for printing and scanning.
I haven't tried "scan key tool".

=====

I have found some problems with scanning or printing.  I think that they 
are on the open-source side (thank goodness).  See, for example 
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1035090>

- duplexing didn't always work as expected

- landscape / portrait things don't always work

- simplescan is great because it is simple but I have had some problems 
  with it

My Ubuntu PVR, calvin, supports a printer which presents a CUPS 1.7.2

usb://EPSON/Stylus%20Photo%20700?serial=066030217dxsc3ei

My local machine running CUPS 1.7.5 sees the remote machine/printer pair as
"dnssd://EPSON%20Stylus%20Photo%20700%20%40%20pvr._ipp._tcp.local/cups"

I think dnssd is DNS Service Discovery, a zeroconf thingie, but it could

Can't decipher how to setup their web based setup tool.

Haven't tried printing (cause I don't want to) but I need the scanning.
Brother tech support is somewhat like molasses going uphill in a liquid
nitrogen tank.

Haven't been able to find anything for info on the bscan4 because its newer
but doesn't just work either.
Trying to find ways to use XSane but can't find a reasonable description of
that either!
Makes me think that scanning is a seldom used activity!

We have a Brother MFC-9120CN (networked colour laser/copier/scanner/fax)
which isn't quite so bad.  There's a specific .ppd to feed CUPS for the
printer side to be happy.  And scanning pushes a choice of .jpg or .pdf
content to a Samba share.  I don't think we've ever actually tried to
send or receive a fax, FWIW.

Before that we had a Brother HL-2030 monochrome laser, which worked fine
but the aforementioned unit was too useful and inexpensive to pass up.
The older printer then got our firstborn through an Engineering degree
and might be wanting a fresh drum soon.

SANE is the collection of scanner drivers

Xsane is a GUI program (crude but powerful) that is from the same
project.  simplescan is a lot simpler.

Any scanning software needs to find the scanner.  googling will show
you the drill (which I don't remember).

| Can't decipher how to setup their web based setup tool.

I didn't use a GUI for setting up my Brother printer/scanner.  There
was a gui involved in telling the scanning software where the driver
is.

What I think that I did:

- installed brscan4 binary

- brsaneconfig4 -a name=BrotherScanner model=DCP-7065dn ip=192.168.2.12
  (a different IP)

- brsaneconfig4 -q
  First device is numbered 0.

Remember to put a hole in your firewall. UDP 54925, I think.

Got all the tasks but the last one. I thought that the firewall is on the
outside of my network
and my url (slightly different that the one listed) is on my network.

Could this be the entire issue?

Not a URL, an IP address.  On my network, all things have static IP
addresses.  So I forgot to mention that issue.  I don't remember how
brscan4 discovers IP addresses.  It might be easiest if you give your
printer a static address (configuring your DHCP server (probably in
your router) to do so).  Then you can tell brscan4 the IP address as I
did.

When you install Linux you are likely to get a simply configured
firewall.  And it is likely to block UDP 54925.  But it depends on
your distro.  I don't know about Debian Testing -- someone else surely 
does.  Maybe useful (first google hit):

To see the firewall rules in gory raw detail:
	sudo iptables -L -v

Cups for IPP.  That way only the print server needs a working driver,
everyone else just uses postscript to the print server.

My firewall is on the router (running DD-WRT) so I was thinking that my
network
should be behind the wall. Not sure how to do any of that and I'm running
out of time
to get the needed work done!

Thank you so much for your advice!

Every machine on a network can have a firewall.  I think the default
set up for Ubuntu/Debian is to have no firewall enabled (Ubuntu
Desktop definitely has no firewall on by default).  So, it's possible
if you have a firewall on your computer that that's why it's not
working.  Try running the "sudo iptables -L -v" as recommended and
confirm whether your system is blocking anything or not.  If that
command doesn't list anything, then it's not a firewall issue.

Looking for some advise about a good registrar for .ca and .com  I've

support and features (dnssec).  I would like to move to someone that is
more responsive and has support for the following

dnssec
ipv6

I was just looking at namespro.ca, and their prices are cheaper for .ca

As far as customer support goes, I've been quite happy with Hover.com.

Not sure about dnssec or ipv6, though it looks like they just rolled out
dnssec... today??

I don't have any recent experience with anyone but easydns.ca for a
long time; I've been with them since 2003.

I have found their customer service to be outstanding, and they are a
class act.  A quick sample of why I am a happy customer can be found
right here: http://blog.easydns.org/

They definitely do DNSSEC, I haven't really looked into ipv6.

That said, I am a big fan of de-coupling my registrar from my DNS
provider, as having the two separate means that you are better
insulated from fraudulent behaviour, rent-seeking and corporate
failure.

Good luck!

I use registeryour.ca too. Amy quite happy with them as a registrar. I

Hello moderators. I lerk in the GTALUG newsgroup often but don't often 
respond. I did response to the last thread for the first time in a 
while, but got a message back saying my message was awaiting moderation. 
I'm expecting this one to as well, and you can choose whether to respond 
directly or to post in the newsgroup and respond there.

Does this group seriously moderate each and every message that passes 
through? Or do you have membership levels with some people requiring 
moderation and others not? Just curious, as if my messages are likely to 
get significantly delayed, then that would certainly have an effect on 
whether I try to post much more in the future.

Message-ID: <CAO1j=qf9+GjNFHwNL1nhmt1dAu2jMdmb+x7Mwp=KCspYoXZMQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I need to organize a remote gui access from several windows machine to a
linux box, running Fedora 22 with GNOME.

The major requirements are -- it's gonna work on a LAN, needs to be
responsive, and the should exist a decent windows client.

I think VNC is a bit too cumbersome, although there might be a better
client out there.

Has anyone used anything more recent? So far I'm most inclined on using
X2Go -- http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php, has anyone had any experience with
it?

Thanks,

Alex.

Speaking as the guy who approved your post.

We don't moderator each individual post just the first post of a new
user (as a precautions against spammers).

I am using xrdp[1] right now for this and it's great because it just
works. It's works while for most basic office-like tasks (i.e. running
LibreOffice, Wireshark, and Thunderbird). I wouldn't suggest it for
running video though. You can use the Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connect
as the client.

What is cumbersome?

I've found VNC to be pretty trivial to walk non technical users through, even
children. If you control the network around the Linux machine you can open
a path to it and even point a domain to it. So no messing around with IP
addresses or firewalls on their side.

Thanks Myles. So a tiered membership then. Guarding against spammers is 
eminently sensible. Now, not to start a flame war, (I haven't actually 
paid close enough attention) but does this group have a preference WRT 
top or bottom posting?

I am happy with Gandi - https://www.gandi.net/.

They provide both of the features you are looking for.
(Assuming by IPv6 you mean the ability to add v6 glue records)

I run my own dns, my registrar just has to get my ns records up to the
parent domain.  Unfortunately, while registeryour.ca allows you to enter
both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses of your dns servers, they are failing to
have AAAA records placed in the .ca servers.  This is holding up my
Hurricane Electric certification, which I need to complete before they
will unblock port 25.

How about rdp which seems to be what windows likes to use.

The 'does not need additional software installed on windows' seems like
a nice feature.

He says "even children," as if they're tough to teach.  Now if you'd
said "even grandparents," that would be a selling point.

I've always used VNC, and have no big issues with it ... but I'm
willing to admit that "cumbersome" is a reasonably accurate
description.  The next time I need such a thing, I'll take Myles'
suggestion and look at xrdp.

True.
Not sure I would consider it cumbersome, but seems these days the
download/install of a desktop program falls into that category.
Better be installed already or make it a mobile/web app.
