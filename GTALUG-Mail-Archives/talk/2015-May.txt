# OpenStreetMap with Stewart Russell

OpenStreetMap is more than just a web mapping platform. It's a
comprehensive, community-maintained map/geodatabase of the world that
you can hack on. Since the last GTALUG talk on OSM over five years
ago, it's grown a lot, and developed a huge community of mappers,
developers and data users. In this talk, we'll discuss the basics of
using OSM, how it survived a major licence change with only a little
drama, and how it succeeds as a community.

## Location

George Vari Engineering and Computing Centre
245 Church Street, Room 203
Ryerson University

<http://goo.gl/maps/16oJ2>

<http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23447525>

## Schedule

* 6:00 pm - Before the meeting a group of GTALUGers will be dining at
It's All Grk (101 Dundas St East).
* 7:30 pm - Meeting and presentation.
* 9:00 pm - After each meeting a group of GTALUGers move to the The
Imperial Pub (54 Dundas St East).

## Code of Conduct

We want a productive happy community that can welcome new ideas,
improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between
individuals with differing needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from
those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that
diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will
challenge prejudice that could jeopardize the participation of any
person in the community.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the Linux community will be judged by our actions. We expect
it to be honored by everyone who represents the community officially
or informally, claims affiliation, or participates directly. It
applies to activities online or offline.

We invite anybody to participate. Our community is open.

Please read more about the GTALUG Code of Conduct here:

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the GTALUG Code
of Conduct please contact one of the GTALUG Board Members @

Subject: [GTALUG] ICANN's Proposal to Move IANA
Message-ID: <1430930541.24607.2.camel@larva.gordhome.local>

Hi, all:

You probably know that in March 2014, the U.S. Department of Commerce's
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)
announced its intent to “transition its stewardship role of the IANA
Functions and related management”.   This meant that NTIA will no longer
oversee a contract with ICANN to manage IANA.   ICANN will have to do it
itself.

To get this started, NTIA called on ICANN to “coordinate” the drafting
of a proposal to transition this stewardship role to the broader global
multi-stakeholder community.    This meant drafting of a proposal of its
own and inviting other proposals from IETF and the various numbers
registries (ARIN, RIPE and the others) and then coordinating them all
into one proposal to present to NTIA.

ICANN now has a (second) draft of its proposal “ready for comment” (this
request for public comment is fairly standard for ICANN policy
documents).

This one is important enough that we're asking you to look it over and
accept ICANN's invitation to comment.   Comments are going to be
accepted until May 20 – that's short, I know, but there it is.

Now, this is a pretty complex document – it's a kind of complex matter,
involving contract law (in California, where ICANN is registered), the
concerns of a lot of stakeholders outside the US, and the need for ICANN
to be seen to be accountable.

So, here it is.   Send your comments to me at gordon at look.ca and I'll
compile them into a group comment for ICANN.

https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/cwg-stewardship-draft-proposal-without-annexes-22apr15-en.pdf

I'm not sure you want to tackle the proposal with annexes.   It's
painful.

Enjoy

Hi, again:

Comes of doing things when you're not awake yet.

I misspelled my own e-mail address.   It should be gordontc at look.ca

Sorry about that . . .
