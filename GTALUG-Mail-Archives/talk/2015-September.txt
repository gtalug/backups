NACK, NACK.

Who's there?

ATM.

ATM who?

NACK, NACK.


"NACK" is a "negative acknowledgement", a very old communications
protocol for "I don't understand". NACK usually forces a
resynchronization or renegotiation between end points. ATM is
"Asynchronous Transfer Mode"; a couple of decades ago it was a
relatively high-speed packet technology that lost out to other
technologies. - via <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1590009/773209>

The TCP joke is a personal favourite:


"Hi, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."

"Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."

"OK, I'll tell you a TCP joke."

"Ok, I will hear a TCP joke."

"Are you ready to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I am ready to hear a TCP joke."

"Ok, I am about to send the TCP joke. It will last 10 seconds, it has
two characters, it does not have a setting, it ends with a punchline."

"Ok, I am ready to get your TCP joke that will last 10 seconds, has
two characters, does not have an explicit setting, and ends with a
punchline."

"I'm sorry, your connection has timed out. Hello, would you like to
hear a TCP joke?"

With thanks to Scott Sullivan who told me this one, I think it's a
great follow-up to the TCP joke:

"I'd tell you a UDP joke but you might not get it."

Which also says a lot about the difference between the two protocols ...

I emailed Gordon Bell about this and he says that he was mistaken about

I used "penultimate" in a draft of my masters thesis but my supervisor
suggested replacing it with "second last" because it was more likely
to be understood and in no way inferior.  He was right.

I have done this once upon a time...  checking the scripts I used:

Step 1: launch qemu with -gdb like so:

qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel /path/to/kernel -gdb
tcp:10.0.0.1:1234 [all the other options]

(In my case 10.0.0.1 is bridged with the host.)

Step 2: Make a gdbinit file that looks like:

set architecture i386:x86-64:intel
target remote localhost:1234
file vmlinux
# this part is deep magic - check /proc/modules for correct offsets
add-symbol-file net/wireless/cfg80211.o 0xffffffffa00000000
# and so-on for whatever modules you care about
continue

Step 3: Launch gdb on the host

YMMV -- I rarely have used an actual debugger for my own kernel work.
I do frequently use gdb to do the same thing as addr2line by running
gdb on the .ko and then "l *addr+0x123" -- to resolve symbols from
oops messages, but you don't need qemu or remote gdb for that.

I haven't done that. I have seldom used gdb directly. If I'm doing debugging 
I use gdb via ddd. The ddd program makes debugging a lot easier (for me) 
than the command line based gdb.

Subject: [GTALUG] No sound from Intel HD Audio -- solved!
Message-ID: <20150902163716.GA3920@node1.localdomain>

Hi,

Finally, I've got sound from Intel HD Audio, through default card=0 !

I recently bought H97 motherboard and i3-4170, because I couldn't afford
electricity for my 125W AMD 8-core and overheating motherboard.
According to my calculation, i3 will pay for itself in a year.

Everything was ok, except sound.  On this H97 board, the default card=0
is HDMI, and audio ports are card=1.  
    - I got KDE making notification sound by changing precedence order
      in "phonon" setting.
    - I managed to get 'mplayer' playing on card=1 by
	    ao=alsa:device=hw=1.0
      and 'aplay' playing on card=1 by
	    -D default:PCH

Still, YouTube or Flash played video, but no sound.  Installing discrete
sound card would not help, because that would only become card=2.

I was about to go back to the AMD block heater, when accidental click
lead me to a solution.  Solution was ~/.asoundrc
    pcm.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
    }
    ctl.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
    } 

Now, I've got sound from default card=1, without those funky
configuration settings.

Last I looked at it (a long time ago), ddd had to be one of the worst,
most buggy, awful ui, pieces of crap I ever encountered.  Even makes
eclipse seem like a good idea in comparison.  So bad I have never ever
considered looking at it again.  I assumed it had to have died out from
being so bad.

Never had the pleasure.  But Kevin, don't fear the command line.  A
well-designed graphical debugger is a good and useful tool, but when you
absolutely need to get into the plumbing; memory setup, ICE hardware
protocols, etc. (ad nauseam) you almost inevitably go sideways from where
the GUI designers intended.  Kvm-qemu kernel debugging probably falls
squarely in this category.  All roads lead to gdb, it sometimes seems...

I know what you mean. When I first tried ddd it would often crash in the 
middle of your debug session if you looked at it wrong, but it did recover.

The UI hasn't changed a whole lot from the early days but it has gotten a 
bit less prone to crash. It usually works for me so I haven't bothered to 
look around and see if there is something better that can be used in place 
of ddd.

I didn't even know they had a Steeles location.  I used to frequent the
Queen store years ago, when I worked downtown.  They had lots of stuff
there, some of it even useful.  ;-)

One item I bought there was an S-100 bus prototyping board, which I used
to build an 8 port serial card for my IMSAI 8080.  I actually populated
3 of the ports, but, with the 8250 UART, it was just as easy to design
the board for 8 ports as 4.  In designing and building that board, I
found a bug in the 8250 that Western Digital was unaware of.

I was in the vicinity of the Queen store recently and saw it was now
upstairs.  The last time I was in there, it was on the main floor and
basement.

gdb's command line is certainly overwhelming to many, but if I was really
desparate for an interface to gdb, I would use emacs, and I am a vim user.

Hi Bob,

Thank you for all the pointers. I may keep bothering you if I still have
issues eh ?

Something you said  " I have done this once upon a time..." made me type
this:

aruna at debian:~/linux-4.1.2$ find . -name "*.c" | xargs grep -i " bob
copeland "

and guess what find says:

Holy Wow ! file system, wireless, usb ? holy wow again.. ( proceeds to fall
off my chair ..)

Yeah 2005 was a long time ago I was still using Windows 3.1 and had no idea
what Linux was :)

Privileged to meet you Mr.Copeland ( So what is it with folks who's names
begin with Bob ? All the Bob's I know are possibly related to Einstein ?
Including our own Mr.Jonkman )

Seriously many thanks for taking the time to reply it IS much appreciated !

Oh yes, the qemu command line is quite something.  I do find the syntax
more understandable than gdb though.

That is probably because you have more gray matter ( gray matter in
this case equates to long years of lived experience + testing +
breaking things then wash+rinse+repeat till you finally fix things.. )

I still *cringe* when I have to fire up qemu.. hopefully someday I
will feel comfortable but right now every single time I do this I
actually do PRAY ! ( Seriously I kneel then PRAY ! yes dat bad.. )

Len, if I may please I am setting up a few servers for a good friend
and they are running Zimbra Servers and Zimbra has it's own bundled
Apache so I do not see the usual /var/www root and the log files are
huge. Seriously huge. Any suggestions on how best to tweak for
performance ?

I also see free -m -l -t telling me it is hogging memory like
anything. Is this a Zimbra issue or ? Once again how best to resolve ?

The logs are purged daily so am guesing teh amount of transactions
through Zimbra is causing the weight ?

This is my first exposure to Zimbra and Servers actually so please
have mercy and be gentle.

Thanks - Aruna

Sure, feel free to CC me as well in case I seem unresponsive,
sometimes I don't read the TLUG list so closely.

As I found then, a great way to learn about the kernel is to write a
file system :)

I now do a small amount of ongoing development in linux wireless for
work, particularly in mesh.  It's good fun.

I did an internet search a day or two back. There are other alternatives to 
ddd for gdb front-ends and found a list of them at
     https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends

One of them that looks interesting is Gede. It isn't available for the 
distro I'm running (Linux Mint) so it would have to be built from the source 
files.

For now I'll stick with ddd. I'm used to it and I seldom need a source level 
debugger so I'm not particularly motivated to search for something else to use.

Another program that has an almost overwhelming command line is avrdude. 
Fortunately I knew of avrdude-gui as a way to tame it. It was old but I 
updated it for use with a current version of avrdude.

One of these days I'll post the updated version of avrdude-gui to my website.

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec-+xVt7Rfz2SP=T56JKqzbWeEck_=Bi1X8bWo+KOZOtxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone! Thought I'd tap the collective brain. I'm looking for a
relatively inexpensive laptop for my son, who mostly just plays minecraft
(and occasionally needs the computer for school work, using google docs & a
browser). Any suggestions of models, or places to buy? I'm looking for
something pretty inexpensive, but with dedicated graphics that will allow
him to play minecraft comfortably for the next year or  so at least.

Thank you!
