NACK, NACK.

Who's there?

ATM.

ATM who?

NACK, NACK.


"NACK" is a "negative acknowledgement", a very old communications
protocol for "I don't understand". NACK usually forces a
resynchronization or renegotiation between end points. ATM is
"Asynchronous Transfer Mode"; a couple of decades ago it was a
relatively high-speed packet technology that lost out to other
technologies. - via <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1590009/773209>

The TCP joke is a personal favourite:


"Hi, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."

"Hello, would you like to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I'd like to hear a TCP joke."

"OK, I'll tell you a TCP joke."

"Ok, I will hear a TCP joke."

"Are you ready to hear a TCP joke?"

"Yes, I am ready to hear a TCP joke."

"Ok, I am about to send the TCP joke. It will last 10 seconds, it has
two characters, it does not have a setting, it ends with a punchline."

"Ok, I am ready to get your TCP joke that will last 10 seconds, has
two characters, does not have an explicit setting, and ends with a
punchline."

"I'm sorry, your connection has timed out. Hello, would you like to
hear a TCP joke?"

With thanks to Scott Sullivan who told me this one, I think it's a
great follow-up to the TCP joke:

"I'd tell you a UDP joke but you might not get it."

Which also says a lot about the difference between the two protocols ...

I emailed Gordon Bell about this and he says that he was mistaken about

I used "penultimate" in a draft of my masters thesis but my supervisor
suggested replacing it with "second last" because it was more likely
to be understood and in no way inferior.  He was right.

I have done this once upon a time...  checking the scripts I used:

Step 1: launch qemu with -gdb like so:

qemu-system-x86_64 -nographic -kernel /path/to/kernel -gdb
tcp:10.0.0.1:1234 [all the other options]

(In my case 10.0.0.1 is bridged with the host.)

Step 2: Make a gdbinit file that looks like:

set architecture i386:x86-64:intel
target remote localhost:1234
file vmlinux
# this part is deep magic - check /proc/modules for correct offsets
add-symbol-file net/wireless/cfg80211.o 0xffffffffa00000000
# and so-on for whatever modules you care about
continue

Step 3: Launch gdb on the host

YMMV -- I rarely have used an actual debugger for my own kernel work.
I do frequently use gdb to do the same thing as addr2line by running
gdb on the .ko and then "l *addr+0x123" -- to resolve symbols from
oops messages, but you don't need qemu or remote gdb for that.

I haven't done that. I have seldom used gdb directly. If I'm doing debugging 
I use gdb via ddd. The ddd program makes debugging a lot easier (for me) 
than the command line based gdb.

Subject: [GTALUG] No sound from Intel HD Audio -- solved!
Message-ID: <20150902163716.GA3920@node1.localdomain>

Hi,

Finally, I've got sound from Intel HD Audio, through default card=0 !

I recently bought H97 motherboard and i3-4170, because I couldn't afford
electricity for my 125W AMD 8-core and overheating motherboard.
According to my calculation, i3 will pay for itself in a year.

Everything was ok, except sound.  On this H97 board, the default card=0
is HDMI, and audio ports are card=1.  
    - I got KDE making notification sound by changing precedence order
      in "phonon" setting.
    - I managed to get 'mplayer' playing on card=1 by
	    ao=alsa:device=hw=1.0
      and 'aplay' playing on card=1 by
	    -D default:PCH

Still, YouTube or Flash played video, but no sound.  Installing discrete
sound card would not help, because that would only become card=2.

I was about to go back to the AMD block heater, when accidental click
lead me to a solution.  Solution was ~/.asoundrc
    pcm.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
    }
    ctl.!default {
	type hw
	card 1
    } 

Now, I've got sound from default card=1, without those funky
configuration settings.

Last I looked at it (a long time ago), ddd had to be one of the worst,
most buggy, awful ui, pieces of crap I ever encountered.  Even makes
eclipse seem like a good idea in comparison.  So bad I have never ever
considered looking at it again.  I assumed it had to have died out from
being so bad.

Never had the pleasure.  But Kevin, don't fear the command line.  A
well-designed graphical debugger is a good and useful tool, but when you
absolutely need to get into the plumbing; memory setup, ICE hardware
protocols, etc. (ad nauseam) you almost inevitably go sideways from where
the GUI designers intended.  Kvm-qemu kernel debugging probably falls
squarely in this category.  All roads lead to gdb, it sometimes seems...

I know what you mean. When I first tried ddd it would often crash in the 
middle of your debug session if you looked at it wrong, but it did recover.

The UI hasn't changed a whole lot from the early days but it has gotten a 
bit less prone to crash. It usually works for me so I haven't bothered to 
look around and see if there is something better that can be used in place 
of ddd.

I didn't even know they had a Steeles location.  I used to frequent the
Queen store years ago, when I worked downtown.  They had lots of stuff
there, some of it even useful.  ;-)

One item I bought there was an S-100 bus prototyping board, which I used
to build an 8 port serial card for my IMSAI 8080.  I actually populated
3 of the ports, but, with the 8250 UART, it was just as easy to design
the board for 8 ports as 4.  In designing and building that board, I
found a bug in the 8250 that Western Digital was unaware of.

I was in the vicinity of the Queen store recently and saw it was now
upstairs.  The last time I was in there, it was on the main floor and
basement.

gdb's command line is certainly overwhelming to many, but if I was really
desparate for an interface to gdb, I would use emacs, and I am a vim user.
