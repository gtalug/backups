Subject: [GTALUG] Fetchmail and Office365 and backslashes, oh my!
Message-ID: <20180704185303.GA14046@amber.utoronto.ca>

Recently we were forcibly "migrated" to Office365 for our email services,
and with the change numerous things were broken.  One of the last things
I cannot figure out how to solve is how to pass an alias email address to
the MS server.  So in .fetchmailrc I have a line like this:

user "prof.bozo at utoronto.ca\department.chair at utoronto.ca"  there with password "XYZZY" is bozo here

But this fails, and in the fetchmail logfiles it represents the username as
not having a backslash:

Jul  4 14:35:14 fetchmail[13829]: IMAP> A0002 LOGIN "prof.bozo at utoronto.camedieval.philosophy@utoronto.ca" *
Jul  4 14:35:14 fetchmail[13829]: IMAP< A0002 NO LOGIN failed.
Jul  4 14:35:14 fetchmail[13829]: IMAP> A0003 LOGOUT

If I double-backslash it, though, I get a double backslash in the username.
Ditto for triple, quadruple, and quintuple backslashes.  Nor does it work
if I single-quote the backslash. 

According to the fetchmail manual, the backslash is used to communicate via
ASCII sequences and codes with fetchmail, and it's pretty clear that this
is part of the problem.

Google turned up a few people with the same problem, but they seemed to
have their problems (from 7+ years ago) fixed by multiple backslashes,
which clearly aren't working for me.

Any ideas?  Our local people maintaining the MS Office365 nonsense dont'
support fetchmail and are not interested in helping ...

I was having the same issues a year ago and basically gave up. I'm not 
100% sure if this will work for you but it magically started working for me.

I switched my O365 account two-factor auth (they use SMS to transmit the 
code, Ew) and had to create a bunch of app passwords[0] to be able to 
connect with my main email client. Randomly one day decided to see if 
this would work with fetchmail and lo and behold it did.

I don't know why it worked or if something was disabled in that year but 
it works now.

[0]: The location where you generate new passwords is here: 
<https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/AppPasswords.aspx>

Off-Topic:

One of the scary things about finding URLs to generate passwords on 
Super User is the fact the `windowsazure.com` whois lookup responds with 
MarkMonitor Inc., they help corporations protect their domain names. So 
you have to check the SSL certificate first to see if it's a valid 
domain. I had to use this command:

echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername 
account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com -connect 
account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 
-inform pem -noout -text

to review if it's valid.

Thanks for the suggestion!  Unfortunately, it didn't work.

I tried representing the backslash in .fetchmailrc as "\92" which is the 
decimal escape ASCII code for the backslash.  It failed, but, oddly, the
logfile has the MS Office365 server reading the username with a double
backslash.  No idea why.  (The same results with octal and hex codes for
the backslash.)

If you put in a single backslash, it vanishes.

A double backslash remains a double backslash.

A triple backslash becomes a double backslash.

Quadruple remains quadruple.  Quintuple becomes quadruple.  And so on.

Either fetchmail or Office365 (or both together) are doing something to
that backslash that seems to be causing the problem.  I can't figure out
what, though.   Arrgghh.  I use Linux to avoid this sort of idiotic issue,
not to have to batter through it.

In a previous life, I worked with one of the people MS hired to do the 
ergonomics of Windows 95.

Their task was to provide a lovely user interface that was *as different 
as possible* from any of Xerox Star, Apple Mac or Unix X11, specifically 
so that people would find them frustrating if they had ever used Windows.

Regrettably, that meant that Windows was frustrating to anyone who had 
ever used a computer.

Net result: they had to compete on quality alone, and Mac won.

It looks like history is now repeating itself. I rather hope with the 
same results.

Interesting.

I take it that this is per department.  I just checked on email to my CS 
email account and it is only touched by Postfix and EXIM servers.

|   One of the last things

I'm not going to help you, I'm going try to learn from you.

I don't understand fetchmail that well -- I set it up many many years
ago and haven't looked at it since.

What's an alias in this context?  Is it like what newaliases(1)
maintains for PostFix or Sendmail?

|  So in .fetchmailrc I have a line like this:
| 
| user "prof.bozo at utoronto.ca\department.chair at utoronto.ca"  there with password "XYZZY" is bozo here

I don't see \ used in this way in the fetchmail manual.  I don't think
it is what they call multidrop.  Is it part of the IMAP protocol?
Where is it documented?

How about two different user lines:

    poll whatever.utoronto.ca
	    user "prof.bozo at utoronto.ca"  there with password "XYZZY" is bozo here

    poll whatever.utoronto.ca
	    user "department.chair at utoronto.ca"  there with password "XYZZY" is bozo here

or even:

    poll whatever.utoronto.ca
	    user "prof.bozo at utoronto.ca"  there with password "XYZZY" is bozo here
	    user "department.chair at utoronto.ca"  there with password "XYZZY" is bozo here

PS: I've heard recommentations for getmail over fetchmail.  I haven't
needed to investigate.

What piece of the software is supposed to handle \ the way you expect?

The sendmail manual seems to say that \ is just a way to denote tricky
characters.  So I think you expect your meaning of \ to be handled by
the IMAP server.  And that the old IMAP server did handle it.

You might not be able to. I have a newish O365 account that staunchly
refuses to use any protocol but MS Exchange. POP3 or IMAP at best
timeout, but feed the same credentials into any exchange/outlook client
and I'm in.

I've also noticed in the main O365 account I pay for, plus a couple set
up for me by past consultancies, was that my login ID was always an
@office365.com, @live.ca (!) or some other MS-owned domain. I could
merrily send and receive e-mail under the company domain, but the
credentials were always at the same domain.

Unpopular opinion: Outlook is the best e-mail client. In many technical
and UX aspects it may be the worst, but it is how corporate e-mail is
done, and that's that.

Well, fetchmail can access O365 as an IMAP client and pick up my mail
reliably (and msmtp deliver it reliably).  That took a bit of fussing
but nothing special.  The problem is in accessing shared mailboxes,
where O365 seems to want the username to be of the form:

   personal.email.account at domainname\shared.email.account[@domainname]

I don't know if the problem is in fetchmail or O365 yet.

My login ID is @utoronto.ca, though the server is outlook.office365.com.
As far as I can tell by looking at the headers, that is the domain name;
if I had to venture a guess, I'd say that the University of Toronto pays
for running its own domain and having Microsoft manage the email.

It might be by broader area -- Arts and Science, for instance.  It may get
you yet.  The University has been filled with proud pronouncements about
its email+ system (which is code for Office365).

Near as I can tell, it's what the MS techies call a "shared email account",
that is, a non-personal email account that isn't tied to a single person.
In my case it's an email account associated with a departmental role (such
as chair or undergraduate advisor).

It isn't, at least not in the man page.  In fact it's worse: fetchmail
seems to reserve '\' as a special character, usually to introduce some
ASCII code.  I've tried replacing the backslash with the ASCII code for
the backslash following fetchmail's rules, but no go.

Interesting!  I'll try it.

I know nothing about getmail, but I'll look into it.  Fetchmail has served
me faithfully and well for decades, and I'm used to it; if needed I'll move
to something else -- but since it has worked so well for so long, and also
continues to work well with all my other email accounts, I'm reluctant to
change my habits to accommodate MS Office365.  I will if that's what it
takes, though.

Yes to both.  It may well be that the problem is not in fetchmail at all
but in how Office365 interprets the string.  I am told that people who
use other clients (Thunderbird etc.) have no trouble with the backslash
addressing, though, so it's still unclear where the problem lies.

All this would be much easier if the IT staff were interested in helping.
As it stands, they intone the mantra that if you use *NIX you're on your
own, and clearly don't know or don't care about the technical details.
Such is the penalty for not swimming with the rest of the fish.

I haven't thought about Outlook and Exchange for quite a while. I remember 
some years ago when the topic came up for someone wanting a Linux compatible 
solution. There was a program for Linux that was compatible with Exchange 
and Outlook.

It has been too many years since I last read about that topic. I don't 
remember the name of the program. There may be more than one solution 
available nowadays.

Just mentioning it in case it offers a way to use some Office stuff while 
staying Linux.

Subject: [GTALUG] Cannot open rescue disk
Message-ID: <a6f6915c-2ed0-25dd-edcc-ace99e47db30@teksavvy.com>

The computer has Debian Jessie installed in it.  One day recently after 
starting it, the BIOS identified the hardware.  It went as far as to 
display the line "Verifying DMI Pool Data ..................." and then 
stopped. The rest of the monitor was filled up with series of 99s

I then tried to use a the Rescue mode on a Stretch net install disk. 
The opening menu of the disk appeared on the monitor, but it did not 
respond to input from the keyboard.  I consequently could not select the 
rescue option.

I checked the keyboard on another computer where it worked.  Using the 
keyboard from the other computer on the one not working also did not 
work there.

The net install disk can be opened on the other computer.  In fact I 
used it there to install Stretch on it.

I did a Google search, but all the references I found assumed ability to 
open the computer from a rescue disk.

Does anybody know why this problem would arise, and what to do about it 
-- if anything -- by way of fixing it.

Regards, Ken Heard

Recently, I found out Bank of Montreal is charging me $10 + tax
administration fee for RRSP account.  I can't believe it.  Maybe some

I don't think that was the problem.  The keyboard was able to function 
before from various USB posts.

I'm not talking about Mutual Funds or ETF under RRSP.  Each of those
funds have their own MER and short-term trading fees.  BMO said the
admin fee is for "registered" account and for reporting to CRA.  I have
RRSP with TD and RBC, but they don't charge any fees.

Hi William

My father and my sister both pay an admin fee on their CIBC Wood Gundy
registered accounts.

I think it's at the discretion of the financial institution.

I can't remember ever having paid admin fees.

 From the BMO website 
https://www.bmo.com/assets/pdfs/investorline/self-directed/commission-and-fee-schedule-2014-11-01-en.pdf

"Fees for registered accounts
For RRSP, LIRA, LRSP, RIF, LRIF, RLSP, LIF, RLIF and RESPs:
No fee when your account value is greater than or equal to
$25,000. An annual administration fee of $50 is charged for RESP
accounts less than $25,000. For all other registered accounts, $100
is charged for accounts less than $25,000".

Subject: [GTALUG] Thermal paste availability / Raising the dead
Message-ID: <CANgc-awO_oVEnW9WgK4p65SUKxLGwE4SSoeFnoo6dSTE0F0bdA@mail.gmail.com>

My main system stopped booting two weeks ago, so had to move back to my
previous system. Fortunately, a lot of my stuff was in Dropbox, so after a
decent interval, many of my files were available on the previous machine.
Yay Dropbox.

There are, however, still a few files on the dead system I'd like to get.
Today I took that system apart, popped the fan off the CPU, and found dried
thermal paste. Hmm.

It's possible that the CPU might be cooked (I was away during the Final
Crash), but on the off chance that it just over-heated and shut down (does
that even happen?), I know I need to clean off the old thermal paste
(Q-tips and rubbing alcohol) and apply new. Strap the fan back on, power up
and see if it boots.

Best Buy only ships this on-line, and Canada Computes doesn't seem to stock
it. Can anyone comment on where they get thermal paste? I could wait for
delivery, but it would be great just to get the stuff and move on.

Thanks for your feedback!

Alex,

  Are you able get the heat sink off without removing the CPU?

  Try taking the cover of the computer off and aiming a big ventillation fan at it.

Are you sure that they are not yet doing it?

A better bet if you're just trying to recover files is to get an
appropriate USB external enclosure for the old system's storage device,
put them together, and plug into your new system for review and copying.

If the old system still has life in it, it should be attempting to boot
from cold start and getting at least a bit of the way down the road
before overheating and refusing to continue; in that case fresh thermal
grease might work wonders.  Blow dust bunnies out of the CPU and PSU fans
and watch that they both spin; replace if not.  But there's a good chance
the old box is pining for the fjords.

Or, just move the harddisk to the current machine.

I would have done that already, but the system I'm using now has compact
power plugs, and the previous has the old style four conductor power plugs
-- otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered the list with this question.

Do you have any of the old external drive cases?Â  Adapter cables?

I bought a big tube (actually a syringe, probably 20-30ml) of white
thermal paste at Neutron Electronics in Guelph for about $10, years ago.
For the amount of repair work I do, that's a lifetime supply.

This link: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000474.htm suggests the
problem is lower level than I thought (BIOS rather than OS, which may
negate what I've written below).  You could take a look and see if their
suggestions help.  Doesn't look like a fun problem to tackle, sorry.  As
they suggest, start reseating or better, disconnecting internal components
one at a time in the hope the problem goes away on one of them.

I use Knoppix ( http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html )
almost exclusively for rescue - I would give it a try.  I'm inclined to
suspect a hardware problem, and if you get the same error after burning
Knoppix to a USB stick and booting, that would be ... well, a partial
confirmation.  Only partial because Knoppix is still, at its core (I think
...), Debian.

If it does boot, you have a much friendlier and better equipped interface
for system exploration and recovery than the pure Debian rescue package.

Message-ID: <CAFNqd5WOTtqngJmfk10rYByootNk4nKjehwr2ZP28-WchGaieA@mail.gmail.com>

There hasn't yet been any discussion...

- Kabul Express is a pretty good "backstop" option if we don't arrive
at anything else

- Aura Foodcourt seems to be falling to near-nothing; perhaps closed already?

- There was a rather spicy Pakistani place a bit further east on
Dundas that we tried last year; it's a bit of a walk, but perhaps???

- I'll note that several Ramen places have been mentioned; I like the
idea, abstractly, but they tend to be way too noisy and crowded for
our crowd.  Kinton, Guu, Hokkaido all come to mind :-(

- We have done Blaze Pizza; it was a bit crowded for our crowd, but perhaps...

I'm bringing this up so that we at least know we need to decide
something; I'm avoiding having a decision so that perhaps ideas bubble
in by tomorrow :-)

This link was useful to me because it explains the problem better than I 
did in my original post.  In addition, I see why I could not find it 
using a google search.  I searched using the same words as the title of 
this thread plus 'linux'.  If I had used as my search text 'Verifying 
DMI Pool Data ...' I would have found the link.  It shows that when 
using search engines you have to choose the right search words -- often 
difficult to do.

So I downloaded Knoppix 8.2, burned it to a DVD.  It did indeed boot the 
offending computer.  I was able to access my /home directory.

I then tried again to boot the computer from the hard drives which have 
Jessie installed.  (There are two hard drives which form a RAID1 
device.) This time the boot completed, no more 99s!

During subsequent bootings from these drives however, using both the 
installed Jessie and the Knoppix, after the message 'Verifying DMI Pool 
Data ...' was displayed it was a long time before they were detected. 
So it is possible that those drives, or perhaps one of them, are close 
to failing.  They have been in use since 2011.  Testing them is 
consequently next on my troubleshooting my agenda.

Thanks for the info.

Regards,

Ken

A delay after the DMI pool data message is usually a case of a dying
disk or corrupt boot sector.

Thanks for all the suggestions and advice.  I installed getmail, and, with
a very simple configuration -- the only kind I can write yet -- it fetches
mail from O365 shared mailboxes just fine.  So I suppose I'll migrate to
getmail from fetchmail, which seems to run more efficiently anyway.

Thanks again!

Message-ID: <20180716034212.GA12210@amber.utoronto.ca>

For those who might be interested, here's the working getmailrc
configuration I'm using successfully with Office365 (suitably
anonymized):

.getmail/getmailrc:

  [options]
  delete = true
  message_log = ~/.getmail/log
  message_log_verbose = true

  [retriever]
  type = SimpleIMAPSSLRetriever
  server = outlook.office365.com
  username = PERSONAL_EMAIL at utoronto.ca\SHARED_MAILBOX at utoronto.ca
  port = 993
  password = PASSWORD

  [destination]
  type = MDA_external
  path = /usr/bin/procmail
  unixfrom = True


That's the complete file.  Here's what seems to be going on.

The first stanza, [options], gives global instructions to getmail.
Here, the first, delete = true, just deletes the messages off the
O365 server after it retrieves them.  The next two lines specify
where getmail should write its log messagees, and that they should
contain a certain amount of detail.

The second stanza, [retriever], tells getmail which account to try
to get the email from.  Note that there is only a single account
listed.  That's a feature, not a bug, of getmail.  If you want to
get email from several accounts, you need to use several distinct
getmailrc configuration files (each uniquely titled), and then run
through them all -- a simple shell script will do that.  Anyway,
here the type variable says that I'm picking email up from an IMAP
server using SSL; the server variable gives the address of the
server.  The form of the username here, with the personal email
address + backslash + address of the shared email account, is where
getmail succeeds in the case fetchmail failed -- for whatever reason
getmail passes that on to the O365 server in a way that it parses
correctly.  (It seems that all "shared mailboxes" in O365 are in 
fact something like aliased subirectories under a personal account
for reasons I don't understand.)  The next two are obvious: the port
gives the port, and fill in your password next.

The last stanza, [destination], describes what getmail should do with
the email.  Here I have it set to hand the email off to procmail for
sorting: type = MDA_external tells getmail to hand over the email to
a distinct mail delivery agent; the value of path tells getmail where
to find the MDA.  The unixfrom = true tells getmail that it can expect
the emails to begin in proper *NIX fashion with a From: line.

In case anyone is interested, here's the relevant bit of procmail
configuration, from .procmailrc:

  # Define variables
  MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
  DEFAULT=$MAILDIR/NEWMAIL
  LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmaillog
  #
  :0:
  * ^To.*SHARED_MAILBOX at utoronto.ca
  $HOME/Mail/DESTINATION_MAILBOX

The variables just configure my local setup; the line ":0:" is a magic
incantation that tells procmail not to keep a copy once it carries out
the instructions in the next two lines; the first looks for any email
where the address (To:) header is the SHARED_MAILBOX, and the last line
tells it to write that email into the mailbox DESTINATION_MAILBOX.

On my first test pass, I had getmail deliver the mail directly to its
destination, so the whole stanza looked like this:

  [destination]
  type = Mboxrd
  path = ~/Mail/DESTINATION_MAILBOX

Here the first line declares that the email is heading for a mailbox
in mbox format, and the second line that the mailbox is as before the
DESTINATION_MAILBOX found at ~/Mail/.

So far, Things Just Work.  Since getmail gets the mail, I assume it
passes the relevant SSL tests.  I'll have to learn some more to make
sure it is using, or at least is able to use, fingerprint validation.
Right now I'm testing and running getmail manually, but I expect to
make it just an ordinary cron job once I learn enough to be confident
that everything works properly.

Just for curiosity, can you try
    "PERSONAL_EMAIL at utoronto.ca"\x5c"SHARED_MAILBOX at utoronto.ca"
in you .fetchmailrc ?  The manpage is not clear whether you can use \xhh
in quoted string (though highly likely).

Tried it, and in fetchmail it still passes the wrong number of backslashes.
As far as I can tell, fetchmail and O365 only exchange an even number of
backslashes: one gets you 0, two gets 2, three gets 2, four gets 4, and so
on.  I have no idea why this should be so, apart from the Universal Law of
Software Perversity.  Doesn't matter if I do straight characters, quoted or
escaped characters, decimal, octal, hexadecimal ...

This is starting to sound like a bug in fetchmail or it is some sort of 
compatibility "feature" with Office365. If fetchmail isn't converting two 
backslashes to one I would talk with the fetchmail people and/or file a bug 
report.

Given that getmail works seamlessly, I'm inclined to think it's a bug in
fetchmail (or a bug in the way it interacts with Office365).  I'll send a
note to ESR about it.

Subject: [GTALUG] SSL Server Certificate
Message-ID: <20180717011648.GB29075@amber.utoronto.ca>

I'm puzzled about how to set up server certificate validation in getting
my email, which isn't surprising given that I understand next to nothing
about the way certificates work.

Here's the particular issue.  I want to check over ssl/tls to see that the
server certificate is valid, and that it matches a fingerprint I have for
it.  So, I know just enough to get the certificate from the server, in this
case from Google:

  $ openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:995 -showcerts > ~/gmail.openssl.txt

By inspection I can see that the certificate is provided by GlobalSign.  So
I do a quick check:

  $ ls -l /etc/ssl/certs/GlobalSign*

Lo and behold, there is an obvious hit: GlobalSign_Root_CA.pem.  So I put
that down as the certificate for the server.

Then, I can get the fingerprint for it from the same file, like so:

   $ openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -noout -in ~/gmail.openssl.txt > gmail.fingerprint.txt

(Getmail uses sha256 as its preferred algorithm.)  I take the fingerprint
from the file and use that to certify the server.


Thing is, the technique doesn't work.  First I get an unhelpful error
message saying that the certificate, GlobalSign_Root_CA.pem, gives an
authentication error.  Well, okay.  If I take that out of the equation
I then get told that the fingerprint is wrong, but this time at least
I'm told what the correct fingerprint is -- and if I put the correct one
in all seems well.

The example above is about gmail, but I have the same problem with rogers
and other servers.  Oddly, the Office365 servers work exactly as they
should.

Two questions, which most of you undoubtedly know the answer to:

[1] If the email gets fetched with the fingerprint, is there any need for
    validating the server certificate?

[2] How can I find out what the correct server certificate is?

s_client doesn't behave exactly as you expect. It needs explicit
instructions to send a -servername when you use -connect. What you're
actually getting if you look carefully is the imap.gmail.com certificate.

Without servername:

openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:993 2>&1 |openssl x509 -noout
-subject -fingerprint
subject=C = US, ST = California, L = Mountain View, O = Google LLC, CN =
imap.gmail.com
SHA1 Fingerprint=BD:94:41:8C:64:D9:B1:43:49:3A:98:68:57:12:51:A3:3C:52:BF:86


With -servername:
openssl s_client -servername pop.gmail.com -connect pop.gmail.com:993
2>&1 |openssl x509 -noout -subject -fingerprint
subject=C = US, ST = California, L = Mountain View, O = Google LLC, CN =
pop.gmail.com
SHA1 Fingerprint=59:B1:5F:6A:BF:F2:28:D9:4A:FC:89:DB:75:FD:7D:65:EC:82:AD:E7

This ends up being the incorrect CA certificate. If you take a look at
the full openssl s_client output, you'll see the chain listed right at
the beginning, including the identity of the authority's certificate:

openssl s_client -servername pop.gmail.com -connect pop.gmail.com:993
.....
Certificate chain
 0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google LLC/CN=pop.gmail.com
   i:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=Google Internet Authority G3
 1 s:/C=US/O=Google Trust Services/CN=Google Internet Authority G3
   i:/OU=GlobalSign Root CA - R2/O=GlobalSign/CN=GlobalSign

0 is the certificate from the server itself, with the subject and CN
matching pop.gmail.com. The 's' field is the subject field of the
certificate. The 'i' field is the issuer field.

Likewise, 1 is the intermediate certificate that Google uses to sign
their public-facing certificates, which itself is the public component
of their private intermediate certificate.

That intermediate of Google's is signed by GlobalSign using the latter's
root R2 certificate. Their root R2 is self-signed, and there's the
entire chain.

So the root that you're looking for is described in that last field of
the intermediate certificate 'OU=GlobalSign Root CA - R2'. Take a look
in /etc/ssl/certs/ and you'll see a file: GlobalSign_Root_CA_-_R2.pem

To see how the chain all lines up, look at how the issuer of one is the
subject of the next.

I've saved Google's pop & the intermediate to separate files to make it
easier. Also note that openssl 'hash' operates on the subject, so it
isn't anything special, it is just easier to eyeball when checking
things as opposed to reading a subject and missing something like 'R2'
for example ;)


---- server certificate:
openssl x509 -in pop.gmail.com.pem -noout -subject -issuer -issuer_hash

---- intermediate Google G3 certificate:
openssl x509 -in globalsign-intermediate.pem -noout -subject -issuer
-hash -issuer_hash

subject=C = US, O = Google Trust Services, CN = Google Internet Authority G3
issuer=OU = GlobalSign Root CA - R2, O = GlobalSign, CN = GlobalSign
6a909d98
4a6481c9


---- globalsign root R2 certificate
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/GlobalSign_Root_CA_-_R2.pem -noout
-subject -issuer -hash
subject=OU = GlobalSign Root CA - R2, O = GlobalSign, CN = GlobalSign
issuer=OU = GlobalSign Root CA - R2, O = GlobalSign, CN = GlobalSign
4a6481c9


See how subjects & hashes line up? Note the G3, R2 bits don't mean
anything special in terms of protocols, they're just labels that Google
& GlobalSign use internally to keep track of their different
certificates. Every intermediate & root CA do these however they like -
just look through /etc/ssl/certs and check subject names to see the variety.

Hope this helps with troubleshooting.

Cheers, Jamon

Off-tangent... Can someone do a talk on "SSL/TLS Certificate" for users,
sysadmin, and application programmers level?  Like,
    - how to create certificate
    - what fields to populate when create certificate.  It seems to
      be sensitive to expiry date, certain fields, etc.
    - how to install them, at server side and at client side.

I understand SSH private/public keys.  But, for the life of me, I don't
understand SSL/TLS or OpenSSL package.
