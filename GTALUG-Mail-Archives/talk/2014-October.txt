Subject: [GTALUG] Xrandr problem
Message-ID: <20141001003622.GA17368@amber>

I have an annoying problem.  I run a two-monitor setup with
xrandr, one monitor in portrait and the other in landscape
mode.  I set xrandr in the .xinitrc file, and it works well.
The only problem is that when I quit the window manager (in
this case goomwwm), the screen goes to black and I'm pretty
sure I never return to the console (blind typing produces no
results).  The computer itself keeps running; I can ssh in.
Any advice or suggestions?  I can't quite figure how to turn
xrandr *off* once it's been set in .xinitrc.  Oh, and if I
boot without xrandr, I go straight back to the console when
I quit X (as it should).

I don't really know how to modify xrandr but I can tell you that part of
your problem is that
xrandr does NOT like multi-monitor setups. This I found out the hard way
when I tried to setup
my multi-monitor system. I had to not enable xrandr as part of my solution.
Perhaps some time
in the future the authors of xrandr will update their solution to better
reflect the real world.

How did you set up your multimonitor system without xrandr?  I'm perfectly
willing to do it some other way -- I'm committed to the solution, not the
means.

Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,

I have been appointed the election's returning officer, aka the guy who
counts the votes.

There are three openings for the board this year. We are looking for people
to fill the vacancies. If you wish to run for the board please send me your
name. Officially, I will need a member to second your nomination, but that
can be done at the AGM in October.

Although this is not a big commitment of time, please understand that it
does involve a commitment. There is one monthly meeting of the executive
which includes the board to discuss operational issues that you are
expected to attend.

Thanks,

Bill

You may recall the "One Laptop Per Child" computers.  They were built to
use mesh among the devices.  However, mesh technology has been used in
amateur radio for at least 30 years.  Of course, with FireChat on smart
phones, it's more readily available.

Sorry for the blank message!! (to the list!!)

I'm running nvidia graphics cards (2 connected to monitors) so its a royal
pain
but I'm running the nvidia drivers. Its not that easy to set up the first
time (I spent
a lot of time the first time) but now its a painful process but its quite
doable.

You need to remove the nouveau driver. Means that first you need to get
your system
running on something else and then you black list nouveau and then you
install the
nvidia drivers and then you need to setup all the goodies and then you can
turf the nouveau
drivers and then you have OK performance.

Hi Peter,

I'm curious to see how your setting up your screens in .xinitrc.
Can you post it?

Follow up question, do any other WMs have an issue exiting with your 
xrandr setup?


For comparison, I'm attaching a script I use to setup various secondary 
monitors with my laptop. As this is a laptop I defined a 'default' that 
sets all other outputs but the LCD to off.

If you run it like below,

     SETDISPLAYS_DBG=0 setdisplays rightof

the script will output the command it would have run, so you can 
investigate it.

     xrandr --output LVDS --auto --primary --output VGA-0 --auto 
--right-of LVDS

Your output names will differ based on your hardware and potentially 
your video driver.

Good question.  I'll try cwm and dwm the next time I'm near that computer.

Hey everyone,

It's not entirely a Linux thing, but it's certainly a Toronto thing.

Anyone know a repair shop which will do Viewsonic Projectors?

I'm under extended third party warranty.  Viewsonic recommended somebody up in Northern Scarborough.   They have a $50 inspection fee (credited to your repair) which is... okay, but I hope I could find something more downtown, but equally reputable and affordable.

If there were no warranty, I would crack it open and look for capacitors :-)

If the estimate exceeds the value, I pay the $50, but I send the paperwork off to the insurance company and collect the purchase price.   So reputable means they'll get the estimate close, they've done viewsonic warranty work, have nice looking paper and accept credit cards.

Thanks,

-Mike

I just wondering what people's current experiences are with cheap Linux web
hosting.  Right now I'm using vps.net and while they're cheap it's not
uncommon to have a 10hr downtime (which I'm in the middle of this
morning).  They don't seem to have any sort of basic monitoring of their
nodes to automatically be notified when a system is down (at least not on
an individual node level), they rely on me contacting them.

Has anyone had experience with digitalocean or linode for fairly long term
hosting?  I've only used digitalocean for occasional VPN use but have had
no issues.

I have used HostPapa for a number of years and I am quite happy with them.

Never any down time that I noticed. And they added a PHP add-on that I 
requested. That impressed me on a shared host.

I have been using Linode for ~15 years and can't say anything bad
about them. They are great. But there have been a few rough patches
the in the past three years (the source code for their VPS management
console got leaked on the internet).

I'm a little scared of DigitalOcean after reading about them on Hacker
News. Apparently when the server has a hardware failure it's protocol
for them to delete all VPS on the server and make everyone start from
scratch (they do provided a backup services but it cost extra money).
I run a small dokku instance on DO and it has never happened to me.

I am using frantech.ca for more than a year, and only got a couple hours of

I haven't lost any data.

And they are cheap. I managed to get a 256MB KVM VPS 250GB Dedicated Space

Wow, that's some pretty good deals!  I have a couple projects that need
lots of storage space but memory and cpu are secondary.  It seems their
250GB unit is $7/mo now, but that's still amazing.

I guess I should have specified that I was looking for non-shared hosting.
I usually need to install my own things that aren't available in shared
hosting environments.  I also like the freedom of being able to install and
run whatever I like, especially services that run in the background.

If you pay one year in advance you will pay $5.36/mo. That's what I did...

Now I have my own private 250GB Dropbox (owncloud) paying a few dollars...
And my own VPN provider, seedbox, testing webserver, DNS server... it's fun!

This is a VPS. You own the box. You can install whatever OS you want
(Linux, a couple BSDs, even WIndows), wherever you want. The machine is
yours. Even if you kill it (rm -rf / or dd if/dev/zero of=/dev/sda), you
can go to the console and reinstall from scratch.

I've been using pair.com for over ten years, and I started using
inmotionhosting.com recently for another project. No downtime or lost data
on either provider.

I have made a bit of progress on the problem -- but only a bit.

(1) The keymap seems to be part of the problem: all the modifier keys are,
    as far as I can tell, dead.  That's why keyboard-oriented tiling WMs
    are more or less stuck (goomwwm, cwm, dwm, etc.)

(2) However, twm works as well as it ever did.

(3) I followed the gentoo guide to setting up kernel modesetting using the
    intel graphics driver, and it made things appreciably worse: when the
    kernel boots and the graphical framebuffer is supposed to take over,
    the screen simply goes black.  I can ssh in, though, and see that
    according to dmesg the inteldrmfb has successfully loaded, so what
    gives?

(4) I also got no joy whatsoever at blind-typing into the console to start
    X, which, again, I could see by ssh was supposedly running but only
    gave a blank screen.


All this on the internal 1680x1050 laptop screen.  So while it was blank,
I thought, why not, and plugged in an external VGA monitor.  Voila!  The
console came up on the external and the internal screens.  Better yet, so
did X with twm.  It seems to respond to xrandr, too.

For one last oddity, I dropped to the console, unplugged the external
monitor, and the internal screen still runs console/X just fine.  Go
figure.

This is all on a Lenovo 3000 n100 0768 model, which I recall was finicky
the last time I set it up (back in 2006 or so).  But I don't recall dead
keymaps, and, while I had to use the i915resolution hack back then, that
should all have been superseded by kernel modesetting...

Me too!

Oh, wait, sorry ...  What I meant to say is ...

I'm going.  I've gone several years in a row, and always enjoyed it.
You'll hit a couple bad talks (but that happens at every conference),
but you're pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot at several others
(and that DOESN'T happen at every conference).  Topics are
wide-ranging and can be unusual.

Me too!

Oh, wait, sorry ...  What I meant to say is ...

I'm going.  I've gone several years in a row, and always enjoyed it.
You'll hit a couple bad talks (but that happens at every conference), but you're pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot at several others (and that DOESN'T happen at every conference).  Topics are wide-ranging and can be unusual.

| From: Peter King <peter.king at utoronto.ca>

| I have made a bit of progress on the problem -- but only a bit.
| 
| (1) The keymap seems to be part of the problem: all the modifier keys are,
|     as far as I can tell, dead.  That's why keyboard-oriented tiling WMs
|     are more or less stuck (goomwwm, cwm, dwm, etc.)

Modifier keys dead?  I assume you mean shift, alt, ctrl.

That's pretty odd.  It doesn't sound like something to do with lack of
hardware support -- those are pretty standardized.

| (2) However, twm works as well as it ever did.
| 
| (3) I followed the gentoo guide to setting up kernel modesetting using the
|     intel graphics driver, and it made things appreciably worse: when the
|     kernel boots and the graphical framebuffer is supposed to take over,
|     the screen simply goes black.  I can ssh in, though, and see that
|     according to dmesg the inteldrmfb has successfully loaded, so what
|     gives?

Sometimes there is a proprietary thingee that gates the display.  For
example, I've had notebooks that had no backlight until something was,
for lack of a more accurate word, turned on.  Can you see a faint
image?

| (4) I also got no joy whatsoever at blind-typing into the console to start
|     X, which, again, I could see by ssh was supposedly running but only
|     gave a blank screen.

SSH from another machine should let you do a lot.

You can look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log

You can actually run xrandr, for example, by setting DISPLAY:
	DISPLAY=:0 xrandr
That probably assumes that you are logged in on X or the ownership
will be wrong.

Perhaps you can log in via blind typing.

| All this on the internal 1680x1050 laptop screen.  So while it was blank,
| I thought, why not, and plugged in an external VGA monitor.  Voila!  The
| console came up on the external and the internal screens.  Better yet, so
| did X with twm.  It seems to respond to xrandr, too.

Did the modifier keys work?

See if /var/log/Xorg.0.log or dmesg or something are different in the
two cases.

| This is all on a Lenovo 3000 n100 0768 model, which I recall was finicky
| the last time I set it up (back in 2006 or so).

Google?  I'm sure you've done that a lot.

Try some live distros for variety?

|  But I don't recall dead
| keymaps, and, while I had to use the i915resolution hack back then, that
| should all have been superseded by kernel modesetting...

Ask it to use VGA instead of intel?

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec_6JXVpUkoDjQuxwTpx3iaMA6K+gv1NnOgDVGoenFtrmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Over at Free Geek Toronto <http://www.freegeektoronto.org/>, we have a
small computer classroom of desktop boxes that run Linux Mint.  Every
couple of weeks we re-install clean images by hand.  The process is pretty
labourious and time-consuming, and we would much rather automate it
somehow.  However, none of us is a real sysadmin, and the tools I know a
tiny bit about (landscape, puppet) are non-free and relatively complex.  We
have very limited financial resources and our volunteer capacity is also a
bit strained right now.  Does anyone have suggestions for a simple, easy
way to automate the flashing of images in a small network?

Thanks as always -- this is my first post on the new list!

Sounds like your doing multi-card, not specifically multi-monitor, am I 
mistaken?

Xrandr works great for multi-monitor, but does indeed assume single 
card. The assumption is not Xrandr's fault, support for multi-card been 
a target feature of Xorg to for the last decade. Multi-monitor single 
cards have been "good enough" for just as long.

Fought with this today actually.
Add to your kernel boot line:

modprobe.blacklist=nouveau

This gets it gone before it's used to by the console.

Can the machines PXE boot?  If so, you could perhaps have normal boot
enabled all the time, except when you want to reflash when you change
the PXE boot server to instead boot an automatic imaging tool instead.

2 cards and 4 monitors
1 monitor in portrait and 3 in landscape mode (wouldn't mind a 4th in
landscape!)

My research showed that multi-card has been a 'hope' for a very long time.
It must be because few people actually run more than 1 graphics card.
I wish there were an easy way to slave cards together (I actually have 3
graphics
cards - - - wanted them for serious numeric processing).

One needs to NOT be running any x window stuff at that time too!

The whole process isn't very straightforward. Its a pity that nouveau
weren't just either seriously upgraded or perhaps deprecated.

Nouveau impresses me given that it is a product of reverse
engineering.

If you were to deprecate it, I would hope that you have an open source
replacement.

o1bigtenor,

Are you possibly confusing the old nv driver with the nouveau driver that replaced?

Lennart, can you explain that process in more detail?  I mean, what tool
would one PXE boot from?

Walter, that is helpful but still sounds pretty time-consuming -- I would
like to find a way to have an unattended re-imaging that can run
more-or-less simultaneously on all the machines.

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec8Q+qQq3cu_ny_-SevpK-epYATUBVRXsZbGmD6K05LHQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I am trying to switch to zsh from bash.  Haven't really gotten many of the
benefits yet as I need to learn the advanced globbing syntax, but it seems
nice so far.  However, the beep is driving my crazy.  for ages I've had my
bash beep set to a flash, which is far less annoying.  in zsh this is
apparently accomplished with the ZBEEP shell parameter, but I can't make it
work.  does anyone have ZBEEP set to a value that actually works for them?

I should say, I am using GNOME and gnome-terminal, which, unlike konsole,
does not have an option for changing the bell to a flash, so I think this
would have to be accomplished in the shell itself.

Thanks, Matt

As a user nouveau feels like it was created to be 'good enough' rather than
to lead.
It is because of the lack of support for multi-card and multi-monitor
systems that
I say this.
In fairness I see a lot of businesses using a 17 or a 19 inch LCD monitor -
- -
someone is really missing the productivity increase that you can get from
more
screen real estate.

My system is set up with 20 desktops where I have 16 defined for different
tasks
and/or needs. This available space makes it easy to switch from one task to
another
without taking a lot of time to find the various bits needed to do the work.

It was a combination of four separate problems, which is why it took some
while to run it down.

First, it turned out that my kernel configuration was not building in the
backlighting module for laptops (thanks for the suggestion Hugh!).  Once I
recompiled the kernel with backlighting, the console reappeared.

Second, the Lenovo 3000 n100 0768, for reasons unknown to me, must have a
strange hardware keymap, because the (left) Windows key, the (right) menu
key, and the PrtScr and Pause keys are all completely dead, according to
showkey.  This, despite enabling "windows keys" in the keymap.  Since the
tiling window managers I was using used the left Windows key and the main
modifier, and exited X using the Pause key, no wonder it all seemed dead.

Third, I had somehow forgotten basic X facts, and in my .xinitrc had set
an xterm to run but without putting it in the background -- which meant
that startx never got to the line running the window manager, and so I 
had X up with no wm, no surprise this didn't work out too well.

Fourth, I needed to run mkfontdir on several files in /usr/share/fonts,
so X would have something with which to draw into an xterm.


No cure for the dead keys, as far as I know, but I can set the wm to use
different modifier keys and work around them.  Now, if I can only figure 
out how to turn off the LCD screen and leave the external monitor on...


Thanks to one and all for the suggestions!

I don't care what desktop environment you use, gnome-terminal is a pile
of buggy shit.  Just use konsole (or even xterm is an improvement).

As for zsh, it seems doing this works:

export ZBEEP='\e[?5h\e[?5l'

At least it did for me.

If the BIOS has an option for network boot, then you could enable that.
Then the server would have to have 'pxe' (pxe boot daemon) running to
send the boot files to the client when it powers on.  This would then
provide the boot menu and such for the client, which could normally be
to load the kernel and ramdisk from the local disk, or to network boot
a kernel and ramdisk that reflash the local disk, perhaps using partimage
to transfer the image from the server to the client.

You might even set up wake on lan if supported so you could remotely
turn the machines on when you want them to do the reimaging of the disk.
In fact a lot of machines can have a different boot order for normal
boot versus wake on lan boot making some parts even simpler.

Sakura is my go to terminal now. It along with oh-my-zsh is a lovely
setup if you're new to zsh. It's gigantic, but once you get an idea of
what you want you can then pare it down.

I have a customized zshrc with years worth of additions so I don't use
oh-my-zsh, but I can see the appeal with the colorize and git plugins
amongst others.

Cheers, Jamon

I haven't used it, but I'm told it's good and it's meant to address
exactly the problem you've explained:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4l/  (Ghost for Linux)

That said, using PXE booting may be a better solution.

  The idea is to make one "reference install" and then copy it to several
USB keys.  Then boot-and-dd from 1 key to 1 machine.  Question... can your
LAN handle several machines installing several gigabytes of OS
simultaneously?

Scott Sullivan did a talk on setting up PXE boot a couple of years ago.  I
recently pointed back to the memories when I put in a new media
machine (Zotac ID-88), and found it wasn't recognizing bootable CDs,
only to realize that some of the messages in the failing boot indicated
a "looking for PXE" step.

I was keen on putting Debian in place, so the following instructions were
relevant to that:
   https://wiki.debian.org/PXEBootInstall

The somewhat oversimplifcation is that you need to set up several things
on a central server:
a) Modify DHCP to indicate the offering of PXE boot
b) Install tftp on the server, and put install files in a suitable place
    so clients may pull them

The "most magical" part, which is open-ended as to how sophisticated
it can get, is the part of controlling what gets installed.

In my "wanna install Debian" case, it was simple enough; I grabbed a
stock Debian netboot install and threw that into place.  I didn't much
care how time-consuming later steps were.  Presumably this means I'll
not likely be pulling many Debian CD images anymore; using PXE is
about as easy, and simpler as it consumes no CDs/DVDs.

If you want to have a bunch of MINT machines with extensive common
configuration, then it's worth jumping through some hoops to customize
the net install so it needs little work later.

There are some instructions on this for MINT:
   http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=197&t=96322

It's worth your while to look into some automation tools for installing
common things that need to be on each machine.  My answer is
cfengine2 (I haven't migrated to v3); others like Chef/Puppet/Ansible.
My sense is that it's likely preferable to have a fairly simple
installation, and use tools to do system management afterwards.

I know Scott has gone through the notion of having scripting designed
to customize Fedora/CentOS installations; that's a different
approach, but certainly valid.  If you wanted MINT, then his scripts
are likely useless to you, alas.

That's a strong bug vague accusation.

What kinds of bugs are you thinking of?

I've recently switched to gnome-terminal from xterm because its use of
scalable fonts worked better than the standard xterm bitmap fonts on
HiDPI screens.

The only bug that I've noticed is that my JOVE editor sometimes is
missing a few characters.  I've been to lazy to track it down but I'm
sure that it is a termcap or G-T discrepency.  (The editor has only
needed a couple of bug fixes this century -- pretty solid.)

Misrendering of VT100 codes.  Really annoying at times.  That being the
primary purpose of a terminal, such bugs are unforgivable.

It is very much the terminal doing it wrong, given every other terminal
using the same termcap is working fine.  And I highly doubt jove has
any such bugs given I have seen issues with vim, less and other programs.
It is almost as bad as hyperterm on windows was (but not quite).

I personally find konsole's tab interface and settings much more
useful too.  But it was the missing characters and other terminal
emulation issues that made me never want to use G-T again.  I haven't seen
any indication that they care to try and fix it (it is part of gnome after
all, where throwing away features every new major version and starting
over is normal, and making things users want to use is not actually
a priority).

Of course konsole went for years with a cut and paste bug where all
lines had whitespace appended to the full terminal width when you cut
and paste, which was really really annoying too, but at least all the
characters are displayed correctly, and they did fix the bug by now.

These 'improvements' suggest that game boxen, smart phones and game playing
are major thrust areas.

I use my computer for work related tasks and and am looking toward process
control systems. So how do I model
a multi-card multi-monitor system that includes real time support  so that
it looks like a game which could also
be accessed from a smart phone - - - then lots of developers will want to
work on the idea?

| Subject: war story (spoiler: dying power supply takes disk drive with it)

Another war story.

| I replaced the power supply with a CoolerMaster RP-650-PCAR that I
| happened to have in inventory.
| 
| Still no joy.  When I turned power on, the CPU fan would jiggle once but 
| there was no other sign of life.
| 
| When I unplugged all the peripherals, power seemed to work.

I have a similar symptom in another computer.  I narrowed it down to
the motherboard: when everything was removed from the MB (all
connections) and it was placed on a non-conductive table, with a new
power supply, I got the same behaviour.

Since the computer is about 8 years old, it isn't worth putting a lot
of time into fixing the motherboard.  So I stopped diagnosing at this
point.

The reason I mention it is to hightlight that the symptom (when power
supply plugged in, the fans start up but shut down after a second or
less; case fan spins slowly) seems to be non-specific.

When I first encountered the symptom today, I went back in my TLUG
archives because I vaguely remembered having posted something with
this symptom.  Too bad that the old posting turned out not to be
useful.

For the curious, here is more of the old posting:

| A process of elimination showed that the problem came up only when I
| connected one of my Seagate 7200.11 drives.
| 
| It seems that the power supply death agony caused the 12V TVS
| (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_voltage_suppression_diode>) to
| blow.
| 
| I was able to get the disk working again (and the data recovered) by
| removing the dead TVS.  See
| <http://forum.hddguru.com/help-with-disconnecting-tvs-from-seagate-barracuda-7200-t15313.html>
| 
| To get at the TVS, I needed to remove the drive's PC board.  That
| required a TORX T6 tool which is moderately hard to find.  I got one
| at Lowes.
| 
| I measured the resistance (DVM on 200 ohm scale) across each TVS and
| found it to be close to 0 on the 12V TVS.
| 
| I poked at the 12V TVS with a fingernail and it came off.  I guess that that
| means that the circuit board was slightly fried there.  But the drive
| now works.
| 
| I don't know if the TVS ever protects without sacrificing itself.  I
| imagine that it does.  So I should probably rescue the data and treat
| the drive as junk / unreliable.
| 
| Since the power supply warranty is only 3 years, I probably cannot get
| anything from Antec.  Since the power supply killed the disk drive
| (and I did an operation on the drive), I don't see the drive being
| covered by the Seagate warranty (the drive was purchased on the last
| week that Seagate offered 5 year warranties on OEM drives).
| 
| But I'm mad.  I think that Antec should have recalled the power supply
| when they knew of the bad capacitor problem.  (I haven't broken the
| PS's seal so I'm not sure that this is a bad cap problem.)  Time for a
| class action suit.  But I'm lazy.
| 
| Anybody had experience with hidden warranties from Antec?

Thanks for pointing this out.  I don't remember getting a notice.  I've 
now registered.

I've attended the last few of these.  I found them fun and valuable.

If only the subway extension were complete.  The various rockets are
not too bad but the queue at the end of day is remarkabe.

Subject: [GTALUG] Seiki 4k monitor
Message-ID: <alpine.LRH.2.02.1410101423490.9702@redclaw.mimosa.com>

A month or so ago I could not resist a 4k monitor for $300. So I bought a 
Seiki SE39UY04 39-Inch TV from Tiger Direct.

Bad:

This is not a great monitor: not IPS, refresh rate of only 30Hz at
3840x2160 resolution, no exciting "smart" features, not a name brand.

And the $300 is not 100% accurate: there was a considerable ewaste
fee, and the price was really $350 + taxes - $50 rebate.

Soon HDMI 2.0 will be here, allowing 60Hz refresh in future 4k
monitors (not this one).

This thing thinks it is a TV.  Too bad.  No Display Port; that would
have allowed 60Hz at full resolution.

A lot of computer video outputs do not support 4k even at 30Hz.  I
tried Zotac Zbox ID-81 Intel HD, AMD E350, AMD C50, ThinkPad W520.
Luckily my MSI GFX650 seems to work (with nVidia proprietary driver).

Nobody but Tiger Direct has them: I think that this model has been
replaced or will soon be.

Good:

It seems quite neat to have all these pixels on my desk.  For now, it
has replaced my long-serving 30" 2560x1600 monitor.

This is less expensive than almost any 2460x1440 monitor and it has
more pixels.  It seemed like a no-brainer.

39 inches seems reasonable for a desktop.  The larger Seiki 4k models
seem less so.

30 Hz is fine for static displays.  Mouse tracking seems more, uh, 
etherial, for lack of a better term.  Scrolling is a little less smooth.  
Quite liveable for a programmer like me.

TD has it on various sales at various times.  Now it is $380 before
$30 rebate.  Oh, it is the last day of that rebate.
<http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=8430969&CatId=7395>

There seems to be an enthusiastic user base.  Even custom firmware!

Hint:

For monitor use, turn noise reduction off and sharpening to 0.
Otherwise there are unpleasant effects on text displayed in a browser
or terminal

They seem to have been trying hard to open a market for this brand.
They dropped at least one name brand in favour of it.

Similarly, I've used Clonezilla to create a reference image, and then
distribute that image to 32 computers in two separate classrooms. It
involved starting each computer from a bootable Clonezilla USB, then
pulling the image from a network-connected computer.

http://clonezilla.org/

When a DRBL server was added, it made things even easier. Normally the
PCs were set to PXE boot, but it would fail and they'd boot from the
hard drive. When the DRBL server was turned on it would respond to the
PXE boot, and re-image the PCs. No bootable USBs required.

Resume Driven Development

Crossed_Wires_Howard_Lake_Flickr 
<https://www.flickr.com/photos/howardlake/4834299551>

I had a conversation recently with Martin Thompson 
<http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/> (@mjpt777 
<https://twitter.com/mjpt777>), a London-based developer who specializes 
in performance and low-latency systems. I learned about Martin through 
Kevlin Henney?s Tweets <https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney> about his 
recent talk at Goto Aarhus 
<http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2014/speaker/Martin+Thompson>.

We talked about a disturbing trend in software development: Resume 
Driven Development, or RDD. Resume Driven Development happens when your 
group needs to hire a developer. It?s very hard to tell a non-technical 
HR person that you need someone who can make good decisions about 
software architecture, someone who knows the difference between clean 
code and messy code, and someone who?s able to look at a code base and 
see what?s unnecessary and what can be simplified. We frequently can?t 
do that ourselves. So management says, ?oh, we just added Redis to the 
application, so we?ll need a Redis developer.? That?s great ? it?s easy 
to throw out resumes that don?t say Redis; it?s easy to look for 
certifications; and sooner or later, you have a Redis developer at a 
desk. Maybe even a good one.

And what does your Redis developer do? He does Redis, of course. So, 
you?re bound to have an application with a lot of Redis in it. Whenever 
he sees a problem that can be solved with Redis, that?s what he?ll do. 
It?s what you hired him for. You?re happy; he?s happy. Except your 
application is now being optimized to fit the resumes of the people you 
hired, not the requirements of your users.

I have nothing against Redis. Substitute any other great tool (Node, 
Django, jQuery, AngularJS ? the list is very long) in any tier of the 
application, and you?ll end up with the same story. If this scenario 
bears any resemblance to the truth (and it certainly does), you probably 
will rinse, substitute some other tool, and repeat. Now you have a 
developer whose job is to make sure there?s a lot of Angular in the 
system. Sooner or later, you have a nice ?full stack? that?s using just 
about everything in the modern bestiary of programming languages and 
frameworks.

This isn?t a good situation. The problem isn?t the tools, each of which 
serves a need and is good at doing what it does. The problem isn?t the 
developers; you hired good Redis, Angular, and Node guys, and they?re 
all doing what they were hired to do. The problem is that your team is 
optimized around the inability to communicate at a critical stage: the 
inability of a technical team to specify what they really want (a 
developer with good programming taste and instincts), and instead hiring 
someone who has a particular skill or credential. Martin and I suspect 
that Resume Driven Development is quite pervasive: an overly complex 
application stack that?s defined by the people you hired, and by the 
current toys that the ?cool kids? on the programming block get to play 
with, not by the requirements of the application.

If it all works, what?s the problem? Well, the problem is that it 
probably doesn?t work. Martin has gotten latencies from tens of seconds 
down to sub-second levels just by stripping layers out of the stack. The 
resulting code is simpler, easier to work with, and much more 
productive: customers buy stuff; customers actually explore the site and 
shop because they?re no longer frustrated while waiting around for their 
request to percolate through an overly complex site.

This isn?t an easy problem to solve. The complete system (software, 
engineers, HR staff) tends to optimize around the wrong problem: 
simplifying the process of evaluating candidates by listing a set of 
skills. In the process, it pessimizes what should be most important: the 
ability to serve customers effectively. The result is a large, complex 
technology stack, a Yak with a lot of multi-colored hair to shave, 
that?s defined by the institutional setting, not the job?s real 
technical requirements.

How do we fix this? It?s easy to say ?hire good people?; but hiring good 
people is hard. When you?re looking for good programming instincts and a 
solid understanding of the fundamentals, certifications don?t help; 
degrees don?t help. But certainly understanding the problem, 
understanding why your ?full stack? has grown so full, is a start. And 
before you ask HR to find a developer who is familiar with AcuteJS and 
Lymph, think about who you really want in that seat.

This is a problem that has been around for some time - many, many years,
in fact.  It surprises me to see this article now.

I've been guilty of this sort of thing myself from time to time - on a
first pass selection, but I was lucky that the client we were usually
sourcing for used a rather brutal questionnaire that demanded to know
when, for how long and for what purpose the experience in some skill was
gained.   That was singularly useful - it filtered out a LOT of people.

The other warning to give, by the way, is to watch what you tell the HR
people.   I once was quizzed for a full 15 minutes on my ability to use
"word pictures" to explain things.  There was not a question that really
covered my technical skills (it was a technical position).  That kind of
thing has happened on a number of such interviews.

Getting past the non-techincal HR staff has long been a problem in the
tech industry.  One thing I've noticed is they don't know their are
equivalents to the name brand they're using.  If you've used one brand
of a tool, you're likely able to use a similar tool under a different
name.  I guess this is the same thinking that causes them to hire people
that know Word, rather than those who know how to use word processors.

Hello everyone,

As I mentioned there are several Raspberry Pi gadgets coming out on
crowdfunding campaigns that I find interesting.

PiTop -- A raspberry pi based laptop that greatly simplifies learning to
work with hardware, robotics and sensors.
Product page -- http://pi-top.com/
Indiegogo campaign --
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pi-top-a-raspberry-pi-laptop-you-build-yourself

SmartiPi -- a very versatile Raspberry Pi case that incorporates Lego
blocks, VGA backplate mounting holes, stacking, GoPro mounts etc.. for
about $21 - 25 USD.

The project is funded at $11,614, needs $14K and has 4 days to go, so it
could really use some help.

kickstarted page --
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/799765240/smartipi-raspberry-pi-b-and-camera-case


I found out about some of this stuff by listening to Raspberry Pi today
podcast, which is a weekly, 30 minute long podcast, very British.

My old linksys wrtg54 with dd-wrt locks up. I am looking for suggestions
for a new router that will accept open source router firmware?

I wish there was a better answer than poring over the docs for
OpenWRT/DD-WRT
http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start
http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices

http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start

Don't know if you're dedicated to dd-wrt: this is of course OpenWRT.
(Ah, Chris has sent this as I'm writing).

My understanding is that, as a brand, TP-Link has been the least
obstructive and makes pretty good products at a reasonable price:
Canada Computers carries a number of them.  I own (among other old
WAPs) a TP-Link MR-3020, which has worked fine - but it's not a home
router, it's a lightweight thing for Pirate Boxes or single user
connections.

I've also been given to understand that Linksys's replacement for the
WRT-54g that they recently put out there with much fanfare, the
1900AC, is A) expensive, and B) not as open as they claim it is, and
therefore not working terribly well as a replacement for the WRT-54G.

If you were okay with the throughput of the WRT-54G, they can be had
used from the usual suspects (I got mine at garage sales, but that's
hit-and-miss - mostly "miss") for $10 or $15.

I recently had my DD-WRT router reset (for no apparent reason... it had
been working un-touched for well over a year).  I then tried to re-set up
my printer server to find that DD-WRT was using OpenWRT packages over 8
years old that no one hosted any more.  I tried to see if there was a newer
version of DD-WRT that worked with my router and it was still the same
version number.

So, if DD-WRT is just using OpenWRT packages I'd say go with OpenWRT.  The
benefit of OpenWRT, too, is that you can package just what you need in your
flash image and save a lot of room for anything else.

Here's a blog entry I used when building my own image:
http://blog.rot13.org/2014/03/building-custom-openwrt-image-for-home-router.html

BTW, I'd recommend getting a router with a USB port.  You can turn it into
a media server, a printer server, and even set it up to use a 3G dongle...
 so many options with OpenWRT!

I'm much more happy with the idea of OpenWRT.  But the penalty is that
fewer devices work.

I just bought this today and hope that OpenWRT will work.  Certainly
no guarantee.  But it is a bargain!

For the same money, I bought a used Cisco 2600 router last week and with
no shipping other than the gas to go a short distance (Steeles to Hwy 7
& back) out of my way.  No WiFi, but then I have a separate access point.

My current router is a TP-Link TL-WR841N running the latest OpenWRT...
limited memory for expansion, but its a cheap and cheerful device that runs
$20-$25. I wrote a post about flashing OpenWRT here:

I had one fail on me under OpenWRT (periodically it'd go dark, staying
up less long each restart) and found a new wallwart worked wonders.

I just bought a used WRT-54G V8.0 today from Value Village for $4.99 +
tax.  I've just finished resetting and testing it and it seems to be
fully functional.

I don't really have a use for it but couldn't resist the price. The
power adapter alone is worth the cost to me. They had a second one
there but it was missing the power adapter.

The subject of this tread is "open source routers". Can you load open

TP-Link seconded: I just picked up a TP-Link AC-1750 (be sure to get
v2 -- v1 will not work with ath10k).  I'm planning to use it as a dev
platform for some wireless stuff.

So far everything is working fine with OpenWRT out of the box, and I
had no trouble compiling and installing my own OpenWRT build for it as
well.  Of course I say this with approximately 3 hours of uptime at
this point, so time will tell.

Message-ID: <CAFNqd5VyCjTT573TtYTF70R3XuH-0cKhhk2qYBSWy43uQBTHCg@mail.gmail.com>

I think I got bit yesterday by the above...

I was noticing terrible resolution speed, so checked messages (btw,
"service bind9 status" provides brief, but decent-ish characterization of
things), and noticed many messages indicating failing resolutions against
IPv6 addresses.

There is a common pair of bits of Bind configuration:
a) One might set options to prefer not to use IPv6 addresses, so in
/etc/bind/named.conf.options, change
   listen-on-v6 { all;};
to
   listen-on-v6 { none; };

b) This was where SystemD got into the mix...

Pass the "-4" option when running named to use only IPv4.  This seems to be
the highly significant bit.

On Debian-derived systems, the usual recipe is to add "-4" to
/etc/defaults/bind
  --> OPTIONS="-4"

However, the SystemD config for Bind9 lives in
/lib/systemd/system/bind9.service, and apparently there is recent change
there that that configuration no longer reads from /etc/defaults/bind, so
that to have named get the "-4" option requires altering
/lib/systemd/system/bind9.service.  Seems like it needs to be altered
directly.

This isn't necessarily a "SystemD bug", rather a packaging bug in Debian.
It still was fairly annoying.

I have yet to report it properly, probably deserves a bit more research, in
case my diagnosis is off a bit.

I have an old v1.1 collecting dust.  I stopped using it because it only
does 802.11g.  My TP-Link TL-WA901ND access point does 802.11n.

Well, if someone were to write it, yes.  The OS comes as a compressed
bin file that's uncompressed at boot up.  So, it would just be a matter
of copying the file to the memory and it will automagically run.

Oops.  The NETGEAR AC1450 (which turns into a AC1750 with slight
hacking) is not well supported by OpenWRT.  Broadcom has not disclosed
enough to support 802.11n or ac in open source drivers.

It does run DDWRT.

I infer from some comments on the internet that the factory firmware
is a variant of OpenWRT.  How annoying.

I think you might want to follow the advice below so your changes don't get
overwritten after next update (Adjust for debian of course):
*Q: I want to change a service file, but rpm keeps overwriting it in
/usr/lib/systemd/system all the time, how should I handle this?*

A: The recommended way is to copy the service file from
/usr/lib/systemd/system to /etc/systemd/system and edit it there. The
latter directory takes precedence over the former, and rpm will never
overwrite it. If you want to use the distributed service file again you can
simply delete (or rename) the service file in /etc/systemd/system again.

Debian won't silently overwrite the file in
/lib/systemd/system/bind9.service (barring doing some particular
configuration to do otherwise!!!); an upgrade would notice the difference,
and ask if you want to overwrite the changes.  Which points at the notion
that there's still a problem; if the options are *supposed* to be
configurable, they should go some place where they will be referenced, as
opposed to there being some question of overwriting things.

Hmm.  Looks like the customization location *might* be
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/bind9.service

Yep, that looks mighty promising.  If I edit that, and check systemd status
($ service bind9 status), I get the warning that...

Warning: Unit file changed on disk, 'systemctl daemon-reload' recommended.

[wait a minute...   Seems like a closer relationship...]
root at cbbrowne:~# ls -l
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/bind9.service
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 33 Oct 16 13:24
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/bind9.service ->
/lib/systemd/system/bind9.service

Same file...

There's a further curiosity; I run etckeeper, to keep the stuff in /etc
under SCM control.  If systemd config isn't in /etc, it's not "under
control" (in more senses than one!).  More research warranted!  :-)

Message-ID: <20141021144924.GA11419@amber>

I'm trying to revive an old computer.

The CPU is an Athlon XP 2500, on an Asus A7X87 motherboard, with 3GB
of RAM.  The internal connections are all PATA.  It has both USB ports
and a DVDRW drive installed.  Up until a month or so ago, it ran as
well as an old computer could, with Gentoo installed.  Then a hard disc
went bad, and that's when the fun began.

The BIOS, which dates from 2004, wouldn't let me boot from a USB stick
(the only options are USB-FDD and USB-ZIP).  So I started burning boot
CDs, all of which fail: Gentoo current install disc; SysRescue CD; the
Debian 7.0 live install disc; Archliinx; and OpenBSD.  As I said, they
all fail, quite early on in the process: the BIOS tells me "ATAPI CDROM:
No Emulation" and then starts loading each disc, but fails one way or
another, never getting through a kernel load as far as I can tell (which
isn't very far).  I have swapped the DVDRW drive out for another one,
with no change in results; I have changed the PATA cable connected to
the DVDRW twice, also with no change in results.  MemTest seems quite
happy with the installed RAM.

The boot failures are inconsistent, but, for what it's worth, here is
how they each fail:

(1) Gentoo install disc: Gets as far as starting to load the kernel when
    the screen goes black.  Sometimes that triggers a BIOS reboot, but at
    other times it just sits there.  Tried several combinations of kernel
    modules: nofb, noacpi, no-hardware-detection, and so on, without any
    making a difference.

(2) Sysrecue CD: Latest version simply segfaults after the "ISOLinux"
    declaration.

(3) Debian 7.0 live install disc: Gets to the menu of choices, and will
    usually allow me to make a choice; picking "Install" in any form 
    causes a black screen followed by a reboot.  Under the "Advanced"
    menu I can run MemTest, though.

(4) Archlinux install disc: Once I got to the menu, with the motherboard
    wildly beeping in the background, but wasn't able to select any of
    the choices.  Every other time it just triggers a reboot.

(5) OpenBSD 5.6 install disc: Starts loading the kernel but freezes after
    printing the UC copyright notice.

Google turns up lots of suggestions for the "no emulation" message,
most of which are either "switch the cable" or "change the drive", both
of which I've tried, as noted.

The next thing I'll try is to remove one hard disc, install it in some
other functional computer, and install a bootable Gentoo (or whatever)
on it there, then reinstalling the disc on the old computer to see if
it will boot from it.  I'm happy (enough) to do that, but I'm bothered
by the brick wall I've hit in trying to do something ordinary, namely
to boot from a CDR.  Any ideas?

Does it have PXE Boot?

I ran into a wall with my Zotec (brand new generation, so pretty
disanalogous in various ways), but when I noticed it spitting out PXE
messages, I thought, "Why not try that?", and had good success.

Unfortunately all I can offer to this conversation is that I'm having a
similar problem!  I've removed the hard drive and tried booting from a USB
drive, I've also tried the different RAM cards individually in case there
was an issue with it.  I even tried removing the video card and tried to
get it to boot from a USB drive with an SSH connection but it never gets
that far.

The machine was working fine before so the last thing left is that there's
a hardware issue with the motherboard.  Unfortunately I don't have a second
motherboard to test that assumption.

Sorry; I mangled the name of the motherboard.

I also forgot to mention that I tried all the boot discs out on another
computer, and they all work perfectly well there.

With apologies, this is just another "this might help slightly" email.
I'd suggest following Tim's thought on removing components and trying
again.  Specifically, the hard drive.  I realize you're trying to
install to it, but see if something like Knoppix or Sysrescue can boot
with the HD disconnected.  I admit it's more a feeling than any actual
facts I can extract from your email, but my guess is that the HD or
the motherboard communication with the HD is messed up, and the boot
process on these various discs is dying when it goes out to probe for
media.  Maybe.  If the CD boots successfully with the HD out, try the
HD in another computer - should tell you a bit.  Hope this helps.

Try a boot disk circa 2005.

This sounds like you have some hardware that is deprecated and no longer
has modern kernel support.

There appears to be no such thing as an A7X87.  Would help to get that
part right at least.

I find it odd if a bios from 2004 can't CD boot.  I was able to CD boot
a machine in 1997.  I don't think you could even install XP by any method
other than CD boot.  Now there is more than one type of CD boot, and
some motherboards might only implement the one windows uses and that
might not be what linux uses.  Also I have seen cases where you could
boot from a CD but not a DVD even with the same exact iso file burned
to the disc.

Is the cd drive set to master, slave or cable select?  If cable select,
are you using a cable select compatible cable and if so is there a device
in the master position on the cable?

Have you tried swapping out the power supply?

I've found that marginal power supplies cause all manner of weird failures.

Sorry; I mangled the name of the motherboard.

I also forgot to mention that I tried all the boot discs out on another
computer, and they all work perfectly well there.

My standard suggestion: when things go strange, especially on an old 
system, replace the bios battery.

If you think the MB might be the problem, one thing I would try is to 
remove the MB from the case, place it on a non-conductive material, 
reconnect all cables and try again.

I always have this problem on my 10 years old Athlon XP... when it refused
to boot, I had this ritual: open the case, remove some cards, put back,
loosen and tighten some screws, and  put all back. It usually worked.

When it didn't, I opened the case, grabbed it by one side, dragged it (not
gently, it's the key) around, and put it back. And it works.

Hi Everybodeee! Last week I happened to run into Mike Kaulbach while
walking down the street in Toronto -- a 1 in 2.5 million chance!
Shoulda bought a lottery ticket...

Mike's hosting another Ubuntu Release Party with Free Cupcakes and
Bottomless Cofffee:

*What*: Ubuntu 14.10 Toronto Release Party
*When*: Thursday, 23 October 2014, 7:00pm to 1:00am
*Where*: Alio Restaurant  http://aliotoronto.ca/
*Location*: 108 Dundas Street West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
*Map*: http://osm.org/go/ZX6BtMGY?m=&node=1113718580
*LoCo Event:*
http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/ubuntu-ca/2920-ubuntu-1410/detail/

There are rumours of a Release Party in Kitchener-Waterloo as well,
but I haven't run into anyone on the street yet...

- --Bob.

The tv-listings supplier I use with MythTV is changing to delivering the 
data from their own servers, and in addition is prototyping a json version.

At the moment, it's not obvious if I need to change anything: anyone 
following this and have experience to share?

Greetings David Collier-Brown!

Schedules Direct has been operating since 2007 to provide a stable
environment for non-commercial media applications to receive TV listings
data, but that does not mean things never change! :)  This may be our
first email-blast since 2007!

We have been informed that Gracenote (formerly Tribune Media Services)
will be ending the guide data service currently used by most members of
Schedules Direct. Their plan is to end support for this service on
November 1, 2014.   Schedules Direct was already hard at work
implementing replacement services.

Please check with your application's support page for your best
solution.   Some applications have chosen to use a new SD-JSON service
that offers a richer data set, while others have chosen to use the
SD-DD service, which is meant to be a drop-in replacement for
Gracenote/Tribune's service.

If your application is no longer supported, there's no reason to worry.
Most apps can continue to function with a change to your system's hosts
file. (details in the SD forum).

Last week I asked Tribune to update their DNS to force half of the
traffic to the SD-DD servers.  The concept was for people with problems
to fail half the time now, rather than 100% come Nov 1.   If you're one
of the folks having problems, check with your application team or us to
help resolve it.

For the most up-to-date news, look for links on the SD website

My son is all motivated to learn Java so that he can hack around in
Minecraft, so I'm looking for ways for him to get started. I have no coding
background either, so I am equally lost.

We are working with Alice right now, and I think it's giving him the basic
idea, but I'm not sure how far Alice can take him. On the one hand I'm
tempted to just start mangling some Minecraft code and learn that way, but
I don't want to ruin the momentum here.

Can anyone recommend something to get him to the next stage?

I've been desperate to get him to start to learn coding so I don't want to
waste this opportunity now that he's actually motivated! :-)

Join a minecraft modding discussion and start trying things, perhaps 
initially by applying someone else's mod to "see how to do the worked 
example".

That's what I do whenever I start in an unfamiliar area (like Halflife 2 
DM, which is not the usual kind of program I work with).

Though I haven't looked at it myself, this book might be somewhat helpful:

This will help you and your son through a simple and practical approach
while learning the Java Programming language.

You can also check some of the online courses available from various 
universities and places such as edX or Udacity (to name a couple). MIT has 
something called OpenCourseware that is self-guided versions of some of 
their courses and are free to use. They have course 6.092 with the title of 
"Java Preparation for 6.170". There will be plenty of other courses and 
tutorials on Java out there you can find if the MIT OCW course is not 
suitable for your son.
