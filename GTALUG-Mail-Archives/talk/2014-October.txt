Subject: [GTALUG] Xrandr problem
Message-ID: <20141001003622.GA17368@amber>

I have an annoying problem.  I run a two-monitor setup with
xrandr, one monitor in portrait and the other in landscape
mode.  I set xrandr in the .xinitrc file, and it works well.
The only problem is that when I quit the window manager (in
this case goomwwm), the screen goes to black and I'm pretty
sure I never return to the console (blind typing produces no
results).  The computer itself keeps running; I can ssh in.
Any advice or suggestions?  I can't quite figure how to turn
xrandr *off* once it's been set in .xinitrc.  Oh, and if I
boot without xrandr, I go straight back to the console when
I quit X (as it should).

I don't really know how to modify xrandr but I can tell you that part of
your problem is that
xrandr does NOT like multi-monitor setups. This I found out the hard way
when I tried to setup
my multi-monitor system. I had to not enable xrandr as part of my solution.
Perhaps some time
in the future the authors of xrandr will update their solution to better
reflect the real world.

How did you set up your multimonitor system without xrandr?  I'm perfectly
willing to do it some other way -- I'm committed to the solution, not the
means.

Good afternoon ladies and gentleman,

I have been appointed the election's returning officer, aka the guy who
counts the votes.

There are three openings for the board this year. We are looking for people
to fill the vacancies. If you wish to run for the board please send me your
name. Officially, I will need a member to second your nomination, but that
can be done at the AGM in October.

Although this is not a big commitment of time, please understand that it
does involve a commitment. There is one monthly meeting of the executive
which includes the board to discuss operational issues that you are
expected to attend.

Thanks,

Bill

You may recall the "One Laptop Per Child" computers.  They were built to
use mesh among the devices.  However, mesh technology has been used in
amateur radio for at least 30 years.  Of course, with FireChat on smart
phones, it's more readily available.

Sorry for the blank message!! (to the list!!)

I'm running nvidia graphics cards (2 connected to monitors) so its a royal
pain
but I'm running the nvidia drivers. Its not that easy to set up the first
time (I spent
a lot of time the first time) but now its a painful process but its quite
doable.

You need to remove the nouveau driver. Means that first you need to get
your system
running on something else and then you black list nouveau and then you
install the
nvidia drivers and then you need to setup all the goodies and then you can
turf the nouveau
drivers and then you have OK performance.

Hi Peter,

I'm curious to see how your setting up your screens in .xinitrc.
Can you post it?

Follow up question, do any other WMs have an issue exiting with your 
xrandr setup?


For comparison, I'm attaching a script I use to setup various secondary 
monitors with my laptop. As this is a laptop I defined a 'default' that 
sets all other outputs but the LCD to off.

If you run it like below,

     SETDISPLAYS_DBG=0 setdisplays rightof

the script will output the command it would have run, so you can 
investigate it.

     xrandr --output LVDS --auto --primary --output VGA-0 --auto 
--right-of LVDS

Your output names will differ based on your hardware and potentially 
your video driver.

Good question.  I'll try cwm and dwm the next time I'm near that computer.

Hey everyone,

It's not entirely a Linux thing, but it's certainly a Toronto thing.

Anyone know a repair shop which will do Viewsonic Projectors?

I'm under extended third party warranty.  Viewsonic recommended somebody up in Northern Scarborough.   They have a $50 inspection fee (credited to your repair) which is... okay, but I hope I could find something more downtown, but equally reputable and affordable.

If there were no warranty, I would crack it open and look for capacitors :-)

If the estimate exceeds the value, I pay the $50, but I send the paperwork off to the insurance company and collect the purchase price.   So reputable means they'll get the estimate close, they've done viewsonic warranty work, have nice looking paper and accept credit cards.

Thanks,

-Mike

I just wondering what people's current experiences are with cheap Linux web
hosting.  Right now I'm using vps.net and while they're cheap it's not
uncommon to have a 10hr downtime (which I'm in the middle of this
morning).  They don't seem to have any sort of basic monitoring of their
nodes to automatically be notified when a system is down (at least not on
an individual node level), they rely on me contacting them.

Has anyone had experience with digitalocean or linode for fairly long term
hosting?  I've only used digitalocean for occasional VPN use but have had
no issues.

I have used HostPapa for a number of years and I am quite happy with them.

Never any down time that I noticed. And they added a PHP add-on that I 
requested. That impressed me on a shared host.

I have been using Linode for ~15 years and can't say anything bad
about them. They are great. But there have been a few rough patches
the in the past three years (the source code for their VPS management
console got leaked on the internet).

I'm a little scared of DigitalOcean after reading about them on Hacker
News. Apparently when the server has a hardware failure it's protocol
for them to delete all VPS on the server and make everyone start from
scratch (they do provided a backup services but it cost extra money).
I run a small dokku instance on DO and it has never happened to me.

I am using frantech.ca for more than a year, and only got a couple hours of

I haven't lost any data.

And they are cheap. I managed to get a 256MB KVM VPS 250GB Dedicated Space

Wow, that's some pretty good deals!  I have a couple projects that need
lots of storage space but memory and cpu are secondary.  It seems their
250GB unit is $7/mo now, but that's still amazing.

I guess I should have specified that I was looking for non-shared hosting.
I usually need to install my own things that aren't available in shared
hosting environments.  I also like the freedom of being able to install and
run whatever I like, especially services that run in the background.

If you pay one year in advance you will pay $5.36/mo. That's what I did...

Now I have my own private 250GB Dropbox (owncloud) paying a few dollars...
And my own VPN provider, seedbox, testing webserver, DNS server... it's fun!

This is a VPS. You own the box. You can install whatever OS you want
(Linux, a couple BSDs, even WIndows), wherever you want. The machine is
yours. Even if you kill it (rm -rf / or dd if/dev/zero of=/dev/sda), you
can go to the console and reinstall from scratch.

I've been using pair.com for over ten years, and I started using
inmotionhosting.com recently for another project. No downtime or lost data
on either provider.

I have made a bit of progress on the problem -- but only a bit.

(1) The keymap seems to be part of the problem: all the modifier keys are,
    as far as I can tell, dead.  That's why keyboard-oriented tiling WMs
    are more or less stuck (goomwwm, cwm, dwm, etc.)

(2) However, twm works as well as it ever did.

(3) I followed the gentoo guide to setting up kernel modesetting using the
    intel graphics driver, and it made things appreciably worse: when the
    kernel boots and the graphical framebuffer is supposed to take over,
    the screen simply goes black.  I can ssh in, though, and see that
    according to dmesg the inteldrmfb has successfully loaded, so what
    gives?

(4) I also got no joy whatsoever at blind-typing into the console to start
    X, which, again, I could see by ssh was supposedly running but only
    gave a blank screen.


All this on the internal 1680x1050 laptop screen.  So while it was blank,
I thought, why not, and plugged in an external VGA monitor.  Voila!  The
console came up on the external and the internal screens.  Better yet, so
did X with twm.  It seems to respond to xrandr, too.

For one last oddity, I dropped to the console, unplugged the external
monitor, and the internal screen still runs console/X just fine.  Go
figure.

This is all on a Lenovo 3000 n100 0768 model, which I recall was finicky
the last time I set it up (back in 2006 or so).  But I don't recall dead
keymaps, and, while I had to use the i915resolution hack back then, that
should all have been superseded by kernel modesetting...

Me too!

Oh, wait, sorry ...  What I meant to say is ...

I'm going.  I've gone several years in a row, and always enjoyed it.
You'll hit a couple bad talks (but that happens at every conference),
but you're pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot at several others
(and that DOESN'T happen at every conference).  Topics are
wide-ranging and can be unusual.

Me too!

Oh, wait, sorry ...  What I meant to say is ...

I'm going.  I've gone several years in a row, and always enjoyed it.
You'll hit a couple bad talks (but that happens at every conference), but you're pretty much guaranteed to learn a lot at several others (and that DOESN'T happen at every conference).  Topics are wide-ranging and can be unusual.

| From: Peter King <peter.king at utoronto.ca>

| I have made a bit of progress on the problem -- but only a bit.
| 
| (1) The keymap seems to be part of the problem: all the modifier keys are,
|     as far as I can tell, dead.  That's why keyboard-oriented tiling WMs
|     are more or less stuck (goomwwm, cwm, dwm, etc.)

Modifier keys dead?  I assume you mean shift, alt, ctrl.

That's pretty odd.  It doesn't sound like something to do with lack of
hardware support -- those are pretty standardized.

| (2) However, twm works as well as it ever did.
| 
| (3) I followed the gentoo guide to setting up kernel modesetting using the
|     intel graphics driver, and it made things appreciably worse: when the
|     kernel boots and the graphical framebuffer is supposed to take over,
|     the screen simply goes black.  I can ssh in, though, and see that
|     according to dmesg the inteldrmfb has successfully loaded, so what
|     gives?

Sometimes there is a proprietary thingee that gates the display.  For
example, I've had notebooks that had no backlight until something was,
for lack of a more accurate word, turned on.  Can you see a faint
image?

| (4) I also got no joy whatsoever at blind-typing into the console to start
|     X, which, again, I could see by ssh was supposedly running but only
|     gave a blank screen.

SSH from another machine should let you do a lot.

You can look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log

You can actually run xrandr, for example, by setting DISPLAY:
	DISPLAY=:0 xrandr
That probably assumes that you are logged in on X or the ownership
will be wrong.

Perhaps you can log in via blind typing.

| All this on the internal 1680x1050 laptop screen.  So while it was blank,
| I thought, why not, and plugged in an external VGA monitor.  Voila!  The
| console came up on the external and the internal screens.  Better yet, so
| did X with twm.  It seems to respond to xrandr, too.

Did the modifier keys work?

See if /var/log/Xorg.0.log or dmesg or something are different in the
two cases.

| This is all on a Lenovo 3000 n100 0768 model, which I recall was finicky
| the last time I set it up (back in 2006 or so).

Google?  I'm sure you've done that a lot.

Try some live distros for variety?

|  But I don't recall dead
| keymaps, and, while I had to use the i915resolution hack back then, that
| should all have been superseded by kernel modesetting...

Ask it to use VGA instead of intel?

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec_6JXVpUkoDjQuxwTpx3iaMA6K+gv1NnOgDVGoenFtrmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Over at Free Geek Toronto <http://www.freegeektoronto.org/>, we have a
small computer classroom of desktop boxes that run Linux Mint.  Every
couple of weeks we re-install clean images by hand.  The process is pretty
labourious and time-consuming, and we would much rather automate it
somehow.  However, none of us is a real sysadmin, and the tools I know a
tiny bit about (landscape, puppet) are non-free and relatively complex.  We
have very limited financial resources and our volunteer capacity is also a
bit strained right now.  Does anyone have suggestions for a simple, easy
way to automate the flashing of images in a small network?

Thanks as always -- this is my first post on the new list!

Sounds like your doing multi-card, not specifically multi-monitor, am I 
mistaken?

Xrandr works great for multi-monitor, but does indeed assume single 
card. The assumption is not Xrandr's fault, support for multi-card been 
a target feature of Xorg to for the last decade. Multi-monitor single 
cards have been "good enough" for just as long.

Fought with this today actually.
Add to your kernel boot line:

modprobe.blacklist=nouveau

This gets it gone before it's used to by the console.

Can the machines PXE boot?  If so, you could perhaps have normal boot
enabled all the time, except when you want to reflash when you change
the PXE boot server to instead boot an automatic imaging tool instead.

2 cards and 4 monitors
1 monitor in portrait and 3 in landscape mode (wouldn't mind a 4th in
landscape!)

My research showed that multi-card has been a 'hope' for a very long time.
It must be because few people actually run more than 1 graphics card.
I wish there were an easy way to slave cards together (I actually have 3
graphics
cards - - - wanted them for serious numeric processing).

One needs to NOT be running any x window stuff at that time too!

The whole process isn't very straightforward. Its a pity that nouveau
weren't just either seriously upgraded or perhaps deprecated.

Nouveau impresses me given that it is a product of reverse
engineering.

If you were to deprecate it, I would hope that you have an open source
replacement.

o1bigtenor,

Are you possibly confusing the old nv driver with the nouveau driver that replaced?

Lennart, can you explain that process in more detail?  I mean, what tool
would one PXE boot from?

Walter, that is helpful but still sounds pretty time-consuming -- I would
like to find a way to have an unattended re-imaging that can run
more-or-less simultaneously on all the machines.

Message-ID: <CAN_Dec8Q+qQq3cu_ny_-SevpK-epYATUBVRXsZbGmD6K05LHQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I am trying to switch to zsh from bash.  Haven't really gotten many of the
benefits yet as I need to learn the advanced globbing syntax, but it seems
nice so far.  However, the beep is driving my crazy.  for ages I've had my
bash beep set to a flash, which is far less annoying.  in zsh this is
apparently accomplished with the ZBEEP shell parameter, but I can't make it
work.  does anyone have ZBEEP set to a value that actually works for them?

I should say, I am using GNOME and gnome-terminal, which, unlike konsole,
does not have an option for changing the bell to a flash, so I think this
would have to be accomplished in the shell itself.

Thanks, Matt

As a user nouveau feels like it was created to be 'good enough' rather than
to lead.
It is because of the lack of support for multi-card and multi-monitor
systems that
I say this.
In fairness I see a lot of businesses using a 17 or a 19 inch LCD monitor -
- -
someone is really missing the productivity increase that you can get from
more
screen real estate.

My system is set up with 20 desktops where I have 16 defined for different
tasks
and/or needs. This available space makes it easy to switch from one task to
another
without taking a lot of time to find the various bits needed to do the work.

It was a combination of four separate problems, which is why it took some
while to run it down.

First, it turned out that my kernel configuration was not building in the
backlighting module for laptops (thanks for the suggestion Hugh!).  Once I
recompiled the kernel with backlighting, the console reappeared.

Second, the Lenovo 3000 n100 0768, for reasons unknown to me, must have a
strange hardware keymap, because the (left) Windows key, the (right) menu
key, and the PrtScr and Pause keys are all completely dead, according to
showkey.  This, despite enabling "windows keys" in the keymap.  Since the
tiling window managers I was using used the left Windows key and the main
modifier, and exited X using the Pause key, no wonder it all seemed dead.

Third, I had somehow forgotten basic X facts, and in my .xinitrc had set
an xterm to run but without putting it in the background -- which meant
that startx never got to the line running the window manager, and so I 
had X up with no wm, no surprise this didn't work out too well.

Fourth, I needed to run mkfontdir on several files in /usr/share/fonts,
so X would have something with which to draw into an xterm.


No cure for the dead keys, as far as I know, but I can set the wm to use
different modifier keys and work around them.  Now, if I can only figure 
out how to turn off the LCD screen and leave the external monitor on...


Thanks to one and all for the suggestions!

I don't care what desktop environment you use, gnome-terminal is a pile
of buggy shit.  Just use konsole (or even xterm is an improvement).

As for zsh, it seems doing this works:

export ZBEEP='\e[?5h\e[?5l'

At least it did for me.

If the BIOS has an option for network boot, then you could enable that.
Then the server would have to have 'pxe' (pxe boot daemon) running to
send the boot files to the client when it powers on.  This would then
provide the boot menu and such for the client, which could normally be
to load the kernel and ramdisk from the local disk, or to network boot
a kernel and ramdisk that reflash the local disk, perhaps using partimage
to transfer the image from the server to the client.

You might even set up wake on lan if supported so you could remotely
turn the machines on when you want them to do the reimaging of the disk.
In fact a lot of machines can have a different boot order for normal
boot versus wake on lan boot making some parts even simpler.

Sakura is my go to terminal now. It along with oh-my-zsh is a lovely
setup if you're new to zsh. It's gigantic, but once you get an idea of
what you want you can then pare it down.

I have a customized zshrc with years worth of additions so I don't use
oh-my-zsh, but I can see the appeal with the colorize and git plugins
amongst others.

Cheers, Jamon

I haven't used it, but I'm told it's good and it's meant to address
exactly the problem you've explained:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/g4l/  (Ghost for Linux)

That said, using PXE booting may be a better solution.

  The idea is to make one "reference install" and then copy it to several
USB keys.  Then boot-and-dd from 1 key to 1 machine.  Question... can your
LAN handle several machines installing several gigabytes of OS
simultaneously?

Scott Sullivan did a talk on setting up PXE boot a couple of years ago.  I
recently pointed back to the memories when I put in a new media
machine (Zotac ID-88), and found it wasn't recognizing bootable CDs,
only to realize that some of the messages in the failing boot indicated
a "looking for PXE" step.

I was keen on putting Debian in place, so the following instructions were
relevant to that:
   https://wiki.debian.org/PXEBootInstall

The somewhat oversimplifcation is that you need to set up several things
on a central server:
a) Modify DHCP to indicate the offering of PXE boot
b) Install tftp on the server, and put install files in a suitable place
    so clients may pull them

The "most magical" part, which is open-ended as to how sophisticated
it can get, is the part of controlling what gets installed.

In my "wanna install Debian" case, it was simple enough; I grabbed a
stock Debian netboot install and threw that into place.  I didn't much
care how time-consuming later steps were.  Presumably this means I'll
not likely be pulling many Debian CD images anymore; using PXE is
about as easy, and simpler as it consumes no CDs/DVDs.

If you want to have a bunch of MINT machines with extensive common
configuration, then it's worth jumping through some hoops to customize
the net install so it needs little work later.

There are some instructions on this for MINT:
   http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=197&t=96322

It's worth your while to look into some automation tools for installing
common things that need to be on each machine.  My answer is
cfengine2 (I haven't migrated to v3); others like Chef/Puppet/Ansible.
My sense is that it's likely preferable to have a fairly simple
installation, and use tools to do system management afterwards.

I know Scott has gone through the notion of having scripting designed
to customize Fedora/CentOS installations; that's a different
approach, but certainly valid.  If you wanted MINT, then his scripts
are likely useless to you, alas.

That's a strong bug vague accusation.

What kinds of bugs are you thinking of?

I've recently switched to gnome-terminal from xterm because its use of
scalable fonts worked better than the standard xterm bitmap fonts on
HiDPI screens.

The only bug that I've noticed is that my JOVE editor sometimes is
missing a few characters.  I've been to lazy to track it down but I'm
sure that it is a termcap or G-T discrepency.  (The editor has only
needed a couple of bug fixes this century -- pretty solid.)

Misrendering of VT100 codes.  Really annoying at times.  That being the
primary purpose of a terminal, such bugs are unforgivable.

It is very much the terminal doing it wrong, given every other terminal
using the same termcap is working fine.  And I highly doubt jove has
any such bugs given I have seen issues with vim, less and other programs.
It is almost as bad as hyperterm on windows was (but not quite).

I personally find konsole's tab interface and settings much more
useful too.  But it was the missing characters and other terminal
emulation issues that made me never want to use G-T again.  I haven't seen
any indication that they care to try and fix it (it is part of gnome after
all, where throwing away features every new major version and starting
over is normal, and making things users want to use is not actually
a priority).

Of course konsole went for years with a cut and paste bug where all
lines had whitespace appended to the full terminal width when you cut
and paste, which was really really annoying too, but at least all the
characters are displayed correctly, and they did fix the bug by now.

These 'improvements' suggest that game boxen, smart phones and game playing
are major thrust areas.

I use my computer for work related tasks and and am looking toward process
control systems. So how do I model
a multi-card multi-monitor system that includes real time support  so that
it looks like a game which could also
be accessed from a smart phone - - - then lots of developers will want to
work on the idea?

| Subject: war story (spoiler: dying power supply takes disk drive with it)

Another war story.

| I replaced the power supply with a CoolerMaster RP-650-PCAR that I
| happened to have in inventory.
| 
| Still no joy.  When I turned power on, the CPU fan would jiggle once but 
| there was no other sign of life.
| 
| When I unplugged all the peripherals, power seemed to work.

I have a similar symptom in another computer.  I narrowed it down to
the motherboard: when everything was removed from the MB (all
connections) and it was placed on a non-conductive table, with a new
power supply, I got the same behaviour.

Since the computer is about 8 years old, it isn't worth putting a lot
of time into fixing the motherboard.  So I stopped diagnosing at this
point.

The reason I mention it is to hightlight that the symptom (when power
supply plugged in, the fans start up but shut down after a second or
less; case fan spins slowly) seems to be non-specific.

When I first encountered the symptom today, I went back in my TLUG
archives because I vaguely remembered having posted something with
this symptom.  Too bad that the old posting turned out not to be
useful.

For the curious, here is more of the old posting:

| A process of elimination showed that the problem came up only when I
| connected one of my Seagate 7200.11 drives.
| 
| It seems that the power supply death agony caused the 12V TVS
| (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_voltage_suppression_diode>) to
| blow.
| 
| I was able to get the disk working again (and the data recovered) by
| removing the dead TVS.  See
| <http://forum.hddguru.com/help-with-disconnecting-tvs-from-seagate-barracuda-7200-t15313.html>
| 
| To get at the TVS, I needed to remove the drive's PC board.  That
| required a TORX T6 tool which is moderately hard to find.  I got one
| at Lowes.
| 
| I measured the resistance (DVM on 200 ohm scale) across each TVS and
| found it to be close to 0 on the 12V TVS.
| 
| I poked at the 12V TVS with a fingernail and it came off.  I guess that that
| means that the circuit board was slightly fried there.  But the drive
| now works.
| 
| I don't know if the TVS ever protects without sacrificing itself.  I
| imagine that it does.  So I should probably rescue the data and treat
| the drive as junk / unreliable.
| 
| Since the power supply warranty is only 3 years, I probably cannot get
| anything from Antec.  Since the power supply killed the disk drive
| (and I did an operation on the drive), I don't see the drive being
| covered by the Seagate warranty (the drive was purchased on the last
| week that Seagate offered 5 year warranties on OEM drives).
| 
| But I'm mad.  I think that Antec should have recalled the power supply
| when they knew of the bad capacitor problem.  (I haven't broken the
| PS's seal so I'm not sure that this is a bad cap problem.)  Time for a
| class action suit.  But I'm lazy.
| 
| Anybody had experience with hidden warranties from Antec?

Thanks for pointing this out.  I don't remember getting a notice.  I've 
now registered.

I've attended the last few of these.  I found them fun and valuable.

If only the subway extension were complete.  The various rockets are
not too bad but the queue at the end of day is remarkabe.
